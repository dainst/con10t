<div class="con10t-toc-entry"> <h4><strong>What is Neolithisation?</strong></h4>
</div> 
</p>
Towards the end of the last ice age (from ca. 12.000 calBC) a process began in the Near East which was to prove decisive for the history of mankind.
 Previously referred to by V.G. Childe as the Neolithic Revolution, this development witnessed the transition from mobile hunter-gatherers to first
 sedentary communities, a process that would eventually culminate in the appearance of crop cultivation and animal husbandry. As we now know this
 transition was not abrupt – as perhaps implied by the Childean term – rather it was a gradual process which unfolded over some five millennia, and
 for which the term Neolithic Evolution is nowadays regarded as a more appropriate label. Undoubtedly, the changes which occurred in this period
 laid the foundations for what is now our common notion of a productive mode of economy, the predominant way of life in modern villages, towns and
 cities. One might even argue that the impact of these innovations on the economies and lifeways of our early Neolithic forebears is on a par with
 the discovery of fire by Lower Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. Certainly, it is a development which is frequently compared with other far-reaching
 transitions in human history, such as the Mesopotamian Urban Revolution from around the 4th millennium calBC, and the more recent Industrial 
 Revolution.</br>
In the course of the last century it became increasingly apparent to archaeologists that the roots of Neolithisation should not be sought in the 
alluvial plains and wetlands of Mesopotamia, but instead along its peripheries, i.e. the hilly flanks in the so-called Fertile Crescent. Forming 
an arc – comprising the Jordan Valley in the west, Mount Lebanon and the Nur Mountains in its centre, and the hilly flanks of the eastern Taurus
 and the Zagros Mountains in the east – the Fertile Crescent forms a natural border around the alluvial plain of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
 Nevertheless, we should also be aware that Neolithisation processes may also have emerged and developed outside of this area. The preconditions
 for the genesis of Neolithic subsistence strategies (i.e. the domestication of plants and animals) is equally feasible in all regions where the
 wild progenitors of domesticated species occur; for example, in the case of wheat and barley, and sheep and goat this region extends from the
 “traditional” core zone of Neolithic development (Upper Mesopotamia, Southeast Anatolia) into central parts of the Anatolian subcontinent (Konya
 plain). In the latter region, current excavations for example at Boncuklu should shed light on this matter in the near future.</p>

In these regions with their different biotopes, human groups would have had access to a rich spectrum of wild animals (e.g. gazelle, aurochs,
 wild sheep and goat, and wild boar), wild crops (first and foremost wheat and barley), and an array of wild fruits, thus promoting sedentarisation,
 while at the same time retaining traditional foraging subsistence strategies (for example, cf. Braidwood / Howe 1960 oder Braidwood et al. 1983).
 This period (Late Epipaleolithic) is especially well documented for the Southern Levant where it corresponds to the so-called Natufian, after the
 eponymous cave site Wadi Natuf (cf. Bar-Yosef / Valla 1991). In addition to remains from caves and their adjacent terraces, the early Natufian is
 marked by the first appearance of long-term domestic stations with characteristic round architecture, e.g. at Nahal ‘Oren, ‘Ain Mallaha and Beidha.
 Although less common in Upper Mesopotamia, contem-poraneous occupations are attested at a small number of sites, including Mureybet in the Euphrates
 Valley (Syria), and at the caves of Shanidar and Zarzi in the Zagros region (Iraq) (Fig. 1). </p>

								in the Near East.</con10t-image>
The Natufian is followed by the Pre-Pottery Neolithic or PPN (10th–7th millennium calBC). First defined by K. Kenyon based on excavations at Tell
 es-Sultan (Jericho) and divided into an earlier PPNA and a later PPNB phase (Kenyon 1957), this division remains valid and is one that is repeated
 at sites throughout the Near East and in neighbouring regions. Important PPN sites in Upper Mesopotamia include Çayönü Tepesi, Hallan Çemi, Körtik
 Tepe, Göbekli Tepe, Nevalı Çori, Tell Qaramel, Dja’de al-Mughara, Jerf el-Ahmar, Tell Halula, Mureybet, Qermez Dere and Nemrik (cf. Cauvin 1994;
 Aurenche / Kozłowski 1999; see also Özdoğan / Başgelen / Kuniholm 2011 und 2012; Mazurowski / Kanjou 2012) (Figs. 1 and 2).</p>
													
<p>In Cyprus, recent research has demonstrated that earliest human occupation can now be dated to the Pre-Neolithic period (Late Epipalaeolithic)
 at sites such as Akrotiri Aetokremnos. However, at present it is unclear whether the transition from Epipalaeolithic to Neolithic was a continuous
 process or whether there was a hiatus in occupation. Whatever the case, earliest Neolithic groups are attested from the late 10th millennium calBC,
 contemporaneous with the late PPNA on the mainland (e.g. Agia Varvara Asprokremnos and Ayios Tychonas Klimonas). Most numerous aceramic Neolithic
 settlement remains stem however from the Cypro-PPNB (e.g. at Parekklisha Shillourokambos, Ais Giorkis, Akanthou / Tatlisu, and Kissonerga Mylouthkia
 ). Domesticated plants and animals were introduced to the island by these early Neolithic colonists, the progenitor species not occurring naturally
 on Cyprus, thus ruling out an autochtonous Neolithisation (cf. contributions in Peltenburg and Wasse 2004).</p>
													
<p>The PPN goes hand in hand with a number of important socio-economic developments, each with their own regional and chronological variants. 
In addition to an ever increasing reliance on domesticated plants and animals, it was marked, for example, by parallel changes in social 
structures, away from traditional egalitarian to more complex hierarchical systems; it saw a shift in architectural traditions, with round-plan
 structures giving way to rectangular buildings; and it witnessed a pronounced diffusion of artistic expression.</p>
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_3.jpg"
								align="left" width="180" alt="Jerf el Ahmar" >Fig. 3: Jerf el-Ahmar.</con10t-image>

<p>Special function buildings are a common feature at many PPNA sites. Often referred to by the more neutral term public buildings, these structures would have served various functions
(communal and/or ritual). Examples come from all parts of the PPNA koine (cf. Rollefson 2005 and Schmidt 2005): in Upper Mesopotamia, e.g. Shrines
 1 and 2 at Tell Qaramel (Mazurowski / Kanjou 2012), Building B2 at Tell el-Abr 3 (Yartah 2004),Maison 47 at Mureybet, and several public buildings
 at Jerf el-Ahmar, such as Building EA 53 (Stordeur et al. 2000) (Fig. 3);

n Southeast Anatolia Buildings A and B at Hallan Çemi (Rosenberg 2011); in the lower Jordan Valley the tower of Jericho (Fig. 4) 
(Kenyon / Holland 1981; cf. Naveh 2003); and in southern Jordan Building O75 at Wadi Faynan 16 (Finlayson et al. 2011a/b). Notably,
 some striking parallels in the structure and decoration of Building O75 at Wadi Faynan 16 and Building EA 53 at Jerf el-Ahmar (Fig. 3)
 testify to common concepts over a very wide region. Turning briefly to Jericho, the function of the tower and adjacent wall at this site
 has long been debated, particularly concerning their defensive properties (Kenyon / Holland 1981: 6-8; cf. recent discussion by LeBlanc 2010);
 alternatively, it has been suggested that the wall might have served to protect the settlement from mud flows and flash floods (Bar-Yosef 1986),
 or that the construction of wall and tower could have been an expression of newly emerging local and regional power structures (Naveh 2003).
 Finally, a differentiation between domestic and ritual architecture must not always be expected; profane and religious elements frequently 
 occur in one and the same building, as might be the case, e.g. at Qermez Dere, Nemrik, and M’lefaat (cf. Aurenche / Kozłowski 1999: Pls. 7-1
 and 7-2).</p>
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_4.jpg" align="right" width="180" alt="Jericho" 
								>Fig. 4: Jericho: The wall and</br>
								tower at Jericho.</con10t-image>
								
													<p>The PPNA is also the period which saw the erection of monumental stone enclosures at
Göbekli Tepe (layer III) in the Germus mountain range, just a few kilometres northeast of the city of Şanlıurfa. The most prominent feature
 of these enclosures are monolithic T-shaped pillars, some of which reach heights of 5 metres and are adorned with a vast array of sculptures
 and reliefs; these enclosures comprise two central pillars surrounded by several and up to twelve smaller T-shaped pillars which were incorporated
 into circular walls with stone benches (cf. Figs. 5-6; cf. Dietrich 2011: Fig. 1 on p. 14 or Schmidt 2012: Fig. 76 on p. 160). Göbekli Tepe is 
 interpreted as both meeting place and ritual centre of late hunter-gatherer groups living in the area in the mid-10th millennium calBC
 (cf. Schmidt 2005; Schmidt 2011; Schmidt 2012; Dietrich et al. 2012; see also Peters / Schmidt 2004, Schmidt 2007 and Hauptmann / Schmidt 2007).</p>

								align="left" width="120" alt="Pillar 2">Fig. 5: Göbekli Tepe:</br>
								Pillar 2</con10t-image>
													<p>Later examples of special function buildings come from the subsequent PPNB.
One prominent example is the so-called Skull Building from Çayönü Tepesi (Fig. 7), one of three special function buildings identified
 at this site (Erim-Özdoğan 2011: 200-202, 207-210, Fig. 21). In this structure, which shows signs of several phases of renewal, were
 found the bones of several hundred individuals which had been carefully arranged in three crypts at its northern end. A PPNB ritual
 building was also discovered at Nevalı Çori (Fig. 8). Equivalents of this rectangular structure, which features central pillars with
 clearly anthropomorphic elements in relief, have since been discovered at Göbekli Tepe (Level II). In the eastern bench of the Nevalı
 Çori ritual building were also found three parts of a smashed composite sculpture, which although only partly preserved can be interpreted
 as a totem-like object comprising a raptor sitting atop two human figures (Fig. 9) (cf. Hauptmann 1993; Hauptmann 2011: Fig. 24a/b).							
 Similar objects are also known from Göbekli Tepe (Schmidt 2012: Fig. 30) and at Jerf el-Ahmar raptors, especially vultures, are a frequent motif in
 pictorial representations (cf. Stordeur et al. 2000: Fig. 11). The combination of humans and vultures is often interpreted in the context of
 funeral rites (cf. Peters / Schmidt 2004: 213), e.g. at Çatalhöyük in the Konya plain where wall-paintings dating to the Pottery Neolithic
 (PN – Levels VII and VIII; ca. 6800/6700 calBC) have been associated with excarnation of human corpses (Mellaart 1967: 166-168, Figs. 14-15
 and 47, Pls. 45-49; cf. Hodder 2006: 137-138 Fig. 57). 
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_6.jpg"
								align="right" width="160" alt="Pillar 43">Fig. 6: Göbekli Tepe:</br>
								Pillar 43</con10t-image>
 Intriguingly, at the same site the wing of a crane was found together in context with
 remains of cattle and dog; this combination of animals is also observed on Pillar 2 at Göbekli Tepe (Level III), perhaps suggestive of their
 enduring mythical association. Both at Göbekli Tepe (Fig. 5) and at Çatalhöyük it has been suggested that human individuals may have dressed
 as birds for the performance of ritual dances. In this context it is tempting to imagine a vulture dance of death, and a crane dance of life
 or rebirth. The parallels between cranes and humans could be indicative of a belief that cranes were reincarnations of the ancestors. This might
 explain why cranes are popular totems and clan symbols, as are other powerful animals (e.g. aurochs, raptors, foxes, etc.) (cf. Russell / McGowan
 2002: 450, 452-453; Schmidt 2012: 116-119, 172 f.). <con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_7.jpg"
                              align="left" width="160" alt="Çayönü Tepesi">Fig. 7: Çayönü Tepesi</con10t-image>
A geographically widely attested group of PPN finds comprise so-called shaft straighteners and plaquettes. These artefacts made of stone are 
frequently embellished with a rich repertoire of geometric motifs and figural representations. While the function of the decorated plaquettes
 is still unknown, the shaft straighteners may have been used for the ritualised production of arrowshafts; a process which may have served to
 								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_8.jpg"
                              align="right" width="160"alt="Nevalı Çori">Fig. 8: Nevalı Çori</con10t-image>
 endow these implements with magical properties, perhaps believed to render them more lethal. Whereas shaft straighteners from the Southern Levant are mainly adorned with geometrical decoration, pieces from Upper Mesopotamia feature a higher frequency of figural representations (Figs. 10-12).
 These representations usually comprise selected wild animals from different habitats, e.g. snakes, foxes, and birds, often in combinations; as
 such, they are reminiscent of reliefs found embellishing the aforementioned T-pillars at Göbekli Tepe (cf. Stordeur et al. 1996: Fig. 2; 
 Aurenche / Kozłowski 1999: Pls. 2-7; 2-12 and 2-13; Köksal-Schmidt / Schmidt 2007, 103-109; Morenz / Schmidt 2009: 22 ff.; Morenz 2013).</p>

<p>An interesting category among early Neolithic sculptures are the stone scepters of Nemrik type discovered at a handful of sites in Upper Mesopotamia
 (Göbekli Tepe, Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe, Nemrik). These pieces, also referred to as pestles, take the form of carefully worked batons adorned with
 the heads of assorted animals and humans, and also bodily extremities. In the case of Nemrik, these figurines were found in two main contexts.
 While fragmentary pieces are associated mainly with burials, complete figurines were discovered in domestic structures (Kozłowski 2002: 77-80 Pls
 . CXXXVIII-CXLII; cf. Schmidt 2005: 15) (Fig. 13).</p>
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_10.jpg"
                              align="right" width="180"alt="Göbekli Tepe">Fig. 10: Göbekli Tepe</con10t-image>
<p>A further group of characteristic finds, especially in the Southern Levant,
are plastered skulls (Fig. 14) attested for example at Jericho, Tell Ramad, Tell Aswad, Beisamoun, Nahal Hemar, Kfar Ha’Horesh and
 ‘Ain Ghazal (cf. Goren et al. 2001; Stordeur / Khawam 2007). Additionally, the same region has also produced finds of modelled sculptures
 and busts from Jericho and most notably from ‘Ain Ghazal (Fig. 15) (cf. Schmandt-Besserat 1998; Aurenche / Kozłowski 1999, Pl. 6-10;
 Schmandt-Besserat 2013: 245-334). In both cases, these objects (plastered skulls and sculptures/busts) have frequently been associated
 with a PPNB ancestor cult. At this point, particular note should be made of Kfar Ha’Horesh, which in contrast to the other mentioned sites
 lacks an evident domestic function. Inhumations and installations discovered here have been interpreted as elements of a possible burial/ritual
 centre (Goring-Morris 2000).</p>
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_11.jpg"
                              align="left" width="180" alt="Jerf el-Ahmar">Fig. 11: Jerf el-Ahmar</con10t-image>
<p>onsidering the selected examples presented above, we can conclude that the early Neolithic was a period rich in imagery, commanding over a manifold repertoire of signs, symbols and metaphors of a hitherto unknown quality. These may have 
been essential for early Neolithic people who were still grappling and coming to terms with both themselves and their environments 
(cf. Cauvin 1994; Watkins 2004; Coqueugniot / Aurenche 2011). Admittedly, our attempts to decipher and understand the intellectual world of the
 early Neolithic are still at the very beginning, albeit that they have already led in some intensive scientific discussions.</p>

                              align="right" width="180" alt="Tell Qaramel" >Fig. 12: Tell Qaramel</con10t-image>													
<p>While PPNA societies lived mainly as specialised hunter-gatherers, in the course of the PPNB (from ca. 8700 calBC) subsistence strategies underwent a gradual transition from predominant foraging to a production-based
 economy with cultivation and animal husbandry. At this point we should note that initial sedentarisation – which can in fact be traced
 back to the end of the last ice age – marked the beginnings of an irreversible process, frequently attributed to demographic pressure 
 and over-hunting, which eventually culminated in the emergence of fully Neolithic lifeways. Nevertheless, clear chronological and regional
 differences in the archaeological record indicate that there was no single (geographical) centre of Neolithic development; rather, the new
 subsistence strategies evolved in different parts of the Near East at different times and followed different courses (cf. Helmer 1992;
 Zohary / Hopf 1993; Sanlaville 1997; Peters et al. 1999).</p>
								<con10t-image src="/con10t/img/jtfourplace/Fig_13.jpg"

													<p>The pinnacle of PPN lifeways was reached in the late PPNB and is most evident in the
emergence of large scale settlements, which in the southern Levant have been referred to as megasites. These settlements are characterised 
by the agglomeration of human groups in villages, extending over several hectares, and with an estimated several hundred to several
thousand inhabitants (cf. Hole 2000). The gradual abandonment of megasites in the first centuries of the seventh millennium calBC has been
 linked to a combination of factors,including environmental degradation, climate change, and the transition to more mobile lifeways, e.g. 
 due to the emergence of nomadic pastoralism as an important new mode of subsistence (cf. Köhler-Rollefson 1992; Rollefson /
 Köhler-Rollefson 1993). Further north, in south-eastern Anatolia, the end of the late Pre-Pottery Neolithic has been associated with a break
 with earlier traditions, apparent in the abandonment and/or decrease in size of settlements, as well as for example the disappearance of 
 monumental statuary (cf. Özdoğan 2010).</p>

													<p>Until relatively recently the end of the PPNB in the Southern Levant (ca. 6900 calBC)
was believed to have marked the beginning of a Neolithic Dark Age which brought cultural and economic decline. Often referred to as the hiatus
 palestinien (cf. Gopher and Gophna 1993: 303-304; Rollefson 1998: 115), this gap in the prehistoric sequence, lasting until the onset of the
 Pottery Neolithic, has become gradually filled in the last decades, a process which began in the 1980s at the Jordanian site of ‘Ain Ghazal,
 where post-PPNB occupation levels were termed Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (PPNC) (cf. Rollefson and Simmons 1986: 160-161). Meanwhile, PPNC
 occupations are known from numerous sites in the Northern Transjordanian Highlands, as well as in northern Israel/Palestine.</p>

<h4>A new approach to Early Neolithic society and symbolism</h4>
</br>
Certainly, any explanation which seeks to assign the wide variety of reciprocal links and diverse interactions contributing
 to Neolithisation to changed ecological conditions is far too simple. Indeed, as early as the 1960s, Robert J. Braidwood 
 asked why the Neolithic Revolution only began at the close of the last ice age and not at the onset of an earlier interstadial.
 This point was later picked up on by J. Cauvin, who for the first time sought an explanation for Neolithisation as a psycho-cultural
 phenomenon, though at this time he was still unable to answer Braidwood’s question concerning the timing of this development
 (cf. Watkins 2010: 621-622).</p>
	
 <p>Since the 1990s (so-called decade of the brain) an increased number of studies in neuroscience, cognitive, developmental and evolutionary
 psychology, and philosophy of consciousness have focused on the development of the human mind and psyche. It is these studies which may yet
 provide an explanation for the timing of Neolithisation. Accordingly, it is posited that at least until the end of the Palaeolithic, human
 cognitive skills were not adequately evolved and that they also lacked the essential intellectual foundation for coping with Neolithisation
 processes (cf. Donald 1991; Mithen 1996; Boyer 2001; Dunbar / Gamble / Gowlett 2010; see also Watkins 2004, 2008a/b, 2010).</p>
 
 <p>It is in the context of this broad intellectual discussion that Klaus Schmidt (German Archaeological Institute, Berlin) and Trevor Watkins
 (University of Edinburgh) initiated a three-year research project “Our Place: Our Place in the World”, financed by the John Templeton Foundation.
 Focus of this multi-disciplinary research project was the investigation of how first large, permanently co-residential communities functioned,
 and how and why they networked. It is held that a better understanding of Early Neolithic worldviews is one way that this goal may be achieved.
 For this reason, Our Place: Our Place in the World brought together selected scientists from several different disciplines, including
 psychologists, philosophers, and cultural historians, in addition to archaeologists.</p>

 <p>An initial workshop for invited members of the Our Place: Our Place in the World group was held in Istanbul and Şanlıurfa between 1st and
 5th October 2012 (for a complete list of participants, see Watkins and Schmidt 2012). The workshop brought together three groups of specialists
 from different disciplines, all of whom had agreed to contribute to the research project. The workshop allowed them to encounter the spectacular
 and impressive architecture and imagery of Göbekli Tepe face to face. In the original plan, we intended to spend one or two days in north Syria,
 so that the participants in the research project could also see something of the settlement sites that are under investigation there. Obviously,
 that part of the programme had to be dropped. In the event, even a one-day excursion to visit sites nearby in southeast Turkey was abandoned in
 view of the uncertainty of the security situation when cross-border artillery shelling occurred very close to Urfa.</p>
 							
 <p>During the first two days of this initial meeting archaeologists presented their results about their work at most important sites like 
 Göbekli Tepe, Jerf el Ahmar, Dja’de, Tell el-‘Abr, Tell Qaramel, Tell Halula, and Aşıklı Höyük, which were discussed and commented by 
 colleagues. The following two days were given to intense discussion, in which the non-archaeologists took the lead, introducing their own
 research interests and expertise, and explaining their interest in applying their disciplines to our multi-disciplinary research project.
 In the last session, the workshop focused on mapping the outline of the interdisciplinary research programme, seeking to articulate the
 essential questions in the right way.</p>
