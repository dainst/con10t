                The iDAI.world now also contains a new project called „The multilingualism of time“ that has been conducted in cooperation with the Einstein Center Chronoi, aiming at developing a tool that is able to normalize and detect time expressions in archaeological literature of varying source languages. This was done by developing a multilingual corpus of archaeological texts, and secondly by adding period terms to an already in use time parser, in this case Heideltime.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Early cultures are characterized by a myriad of systems that structure and periodize time.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Founding dates, dynasties, terms of office, or events can serve as points of reference. Attempts were already being made in antiquity to correlate this multitude of systems. The transformation to post-ancient time calculations and their translation into science resulted in a multiplicity of period concepts that is difficult to manage. The Middle Imperial era, the Antonine dynasty, and the 2nd AD can be used to refer to the same time periods. Accordingly, different naming conventions are used even within the scope of European scientific systems.
            </p>
            <p>
            	If this view is expanded to encompass world archaeology, the result is an almost overwhelming multiplicity that is nonetheless significant for the respective conceptions and scientific cultures. This multilingualism becomes especially relevant the moment it becomes the object of automated analysis, for example, when comparing databases or performing text mining.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The problem we are facing is the fact that computers cannot process period terms in the same way as human beings. Many temporal terms are simply a relative expression to a given date and time, which is understandable to a human being by context. Computers need absolute temporal terms such as a definite year or date. Time periods pose a similar problem as the definition is not always the same in each region of the world. It is necessary to use a time parser that can detect a temporal term and thus normalized it, e.g. give it a numerical value.
            </p>
            <p>
            	A time parser can work with two categories of temporal terms: first being regular time expressions that can be identified and normalized by any competent speaker of the language and the second being temponyms, meaning spans of time that can be identified only with outside information.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The project „mulitlingualism of time“ used material from archaeological journals from different geographical regions and publication dates in order to cover a wide range of expressions in the five example languages: English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. 50 contiguous sentences were chosen in each text and annotated manually.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The time parser used for the project was Heideltime, already being very adequate in its annotations. Temponyms proved to be harder for the time parser than regular time expressions.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Generally, the project opened a discussion about including time parsers into search engines and further using machine learning to work more on these questions under investigation.
