            <p><strong>Prof. Dr. Ortwin Dally, Prof. Dr. Reinhard Förtsch, Prof. Dr.
                Henner v. Hesberg</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Website of the Corpus of Ancient Sarcophagi</strong></p>
            <p>In cooperation with the German Archaeological Institute, the CoDArchLab
                takes part in the re-conception of the Corpus of Ancient Sarcophagi and
                from an IT point of view, assumes responsibility for backing up an
                online-presence of the material, which is to be as coherent as possible.
                The Corpus was determined for collection and publication of sarcophagi of
                the Roman Empire by the German Archaeological Institute in the year 1870.
                An adequate, software based structuring is to be developed in a pilot phase
                financed by the University of Cologne and arbitrarily implemented on chosen
                categories. It is also possible to use the great, partly digitalized photo
                holdings on ancient sarcophagus plastic of the CoDArchLab. One leading
                aspect is to make the formalization and recyclability of the elicitation of
                the material a central editorial principle. Up to now the editing of the
                volumes was handled so that each author compiled the documentation in
                literature and photographs himself. Therefore the institute lacks an
                overall object collection or file. This poses a serious conceptual deficit,
                not only editorially but also for and in times of digitalized information,
                since the collected information outside of the format of the published
                volumes went lost. Thus all material conditioning of new volumes is to be
                conducted in ARACHNE by a formalized process, so that personal changes
                during processing are more bearable. That way it is possible to make the
                already processed information available to science in the database even if
                the project was closed. A second leading aspect is the substantial
                conception of web processing, in which the functional and regional scenic
                contexts, regarding contents, are to be considered more strongly than by
                the previously applied principle, which has barely been changed since the
                19th century and treats one mythological figure or category after the
                other. The footing for this is a “fixed” website of the DAI for the corpus
                of sarcophagi. Among other things, it contains “fixed” appropriate pages
                with persistent URL for individual volumes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initially, for previously published volumes, the automatically
                    allocated new finds, which were extracted from ARACHNE and unveiled only
                    after the volume was published
                </li>
                <li>A gradually performed, retrospective digitalization of the issued
                    material for previously published volumes
                </li>
                <li>For newly published volumes with automatically allocated total
                    documentation of the material, extracted from ARACHNE
                </li>
            </ul>
            “Fixed” appropriate pages with persistent URL for navigation within
            the sarcophagi only:
            <ul>
                <li>By functional contexts, regions, chronological criteria, themes or
                    else combinations of these four criteria
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The material of the sarcophagus corpus seems to be prominently
                distinguished by several criteria: Tradition, international significance,
                generic homogeneity of the material, a high degree of chronological and
                contextual determinability of the individual objects and the capability to
                contextualize multi-figured scenes. Therefore it is a particularly suitable
                domain to represent the technical discourse structure by using metadata
                models from the information technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Museo Gregoriano Profano, Funerary Monuments 3. Sarcophagi and
                Reliefs of the Equites Singulares.</strong></p>
            <p>By request of the Vatican Museum, the sarcophagi were also made subject
                to the catalogue processing. Their argument for including the sarcophagi in
                the publication series was that they had only partly been registered by the
                sarcophagi corpus of the German Archaeological Institute, provided that
                they fit into the previously discussed iconographical subject area. But a
                general pattern for these monuments is not available, even though some of
                them originate from closed necropolis contexts. Special focus is made on
                the study of these contexts in particular. They would find a reasonable
                place within the catalogue of the Sculpture of the Museo Gregoriano
                Profano, which has been adopted by the CodArchLab. According to Prof. Dr.
                G- Koch this would not cause any interference of interests on his behalf.
                The reliefs of the equites singulares offer the possibility to get to know
                an intensely studied group of Roman officials in their urban monumental
                representation, especially in the northwestern provinces.</p>
