            <h3>Notes to the User</h3>
            <p>
                On technical and editorial grounds, the complete collection is not yet
                searchable online (as of August 2013). The objects remaining to be added,
                primarily from the storerooms, will soon be made available.
            </p>
            <p>
                The complete catalog of sculptures in the Antiquities Collection of the
                State Museums of Berlin contains approximately 2,600 Greek, Cypriot,
                Etruscan, and Roman sculptures in stone, as well as several large bronzes.
                Some of these pieces are now lost, but nevertheless have been included in
                the catalog. The detailed research texts retain the character of a
                traditional sculpture catalog. Online publication, however, allows these to
                be augmented by the various advantages of electronic media: texts and
                images of individual objects are linked to comparatives and reproductions, as
                well as architectural and topographic contexts. Moreover, monuments with
                multiple parts are optimally represented – since smaller fragments, often
                still unpublished, are now linked to each other. The user therefore has
                manifold opportunities to engage with the Berlin sculptures.

            <h4>Searching</h4>
            <p>
                The sculptures of the Berlin Antiquities Collection can be directly
                searched using the search bar on the dedicated home page of the catalog
                within the Arachne database. Users may search by name for the author of an
                individual entry, by inventory number, or by a simple search in the
                designated search bar. Alternatively, the Berlin sculptures can be accessed
                through the general search options targeting all objects assembled in the
                Arachne database.

            <p>
                The records for the Berlin sculptures are linked to other objects and
                relevant data, including collection history, topography, and post-antique
                reception (reproductions, digitized archives, prints and other works on
                paper). These are accessible through the context browser.
