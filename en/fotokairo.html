            <h3>History</h3>

            <p>The Cairo Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) was
                founded in 1907. The photographic inventory was confiscated as a result
                of World War II. After the War, the DAI officially transferred the inventory
                to the Supreme Council of Antiquities. Since the reopening of the Institute
                in 1957, a new photo archive has gradually been established. Approximately
                250,000 photographs of various types (35mm b/w film, slides, 6x6 medium
                format, sheet film, glass plates) are presently being managed by the archive.
                Digital photographs have been included in the archive since 2001.</p>

            <h3>Inventory and Focus</h3>

            <p>The photo archive of the Cairo Department focuses on the documentation
                of the department's excavations in Egypt since the reopening of the Institute
                in 1957. The archive comprises ca. 240,000 medium format (b/w, colour)
                photographs, slides and 35mm-b/w-pictures. It also includes photographs
                which were taken in the museums and magazines in Egypt by request of colleagues
                (ca. 10,000 images). Furthermore, the department owns ca. 6,000 glass plates
                and large format photographs from the museums in Cairo as well as photographs
                from the Keimer-Archive.</p>

            <h3>Services</h3>

            <p>The archive in Cairo is primarily devoted to publishing the Institute's
                own projects and the planned publications within the series of the Cairo
                department. At the same time, it assists colleagues in researching photographs
                and illustrating publications. The archive continues to be open to commercial
                users.</p>
            <p>The main tasks include processing photo requests (conducting photo research
                and making selection of images according to the order), digital photo transfer
                (high resolution images for printing) as well as clarifying requests about
                copy and usage rights.</p>

            <h3>Using the archive</h3>

            <p>The archive is open to colleagues conducting research and commercial users.
                Reimbursement of costs and user fees are based on the type of usage. The
                photographs are only available for a specific use within the general terms
                and conditions (only in German: PDF) of the DAI; payment of arising costs
                (e.g. for processing inquiries, making copies, postage and handling and-when
                necessary-for new photography) is required in full before the order will
                be processed. A charge for each use will be calculated based on the DAI's
                rate of fees.</p>
