            <p>The catalogd of funerary monuments is organized by military units. In assigning
                the objects the unit is taken into account to which the deceased belonged
                at time of his death. Within the units the funerary monuments are sorted by
                genres and listed in a chronological order. The veterans' funerary monuments
                were appended to the monuments of the soldiers' who died in active service
                of the respective unit. Funerary monuments, which because of their fragmentary
                state of preservation, cannot positively be assigned to a unit are listed
                as "not accurately distinguishable soldiers and veterans" in the catalog and
                are marked with an "M" for miles.</p>
            <p>For untraceable objects the description of shape and ornamentation were
                taken from the CIL, the NSc or the BCom. Since the term "cippus" is used
                for both stele and altars in the CIL, the designation of the form is uncertain.
                Nevertheless during the investigation it became apparent that the term
                "cippus Marmoreus" usually refers to funerary altars. Furthermore when the
                material "travertine" is named in the CIL, "cippus" are mostly stele. The
                catalog includes also objects, which today no longer exist in Rome, but
                are proven to originate from there.</p>
            <p>The catalog numbers consist of a combination of letters and numbers.
                The abbreviation consists of the first letter of the unit (cohortes praetoriae
                = CP). If the deceased is a veteran, the unit's abbreviation is prefixed
                the letter ›V‹ (veteranus cohortis praetoriae = VCP). The numbering of
                every unit starts with 001.</p>
