            <p>In 1873 August Mau published his ground-breaking discovery that the wall
                paintings in the houses of Pompeii do not date back to the town's last
                twenty or thirty years, before it was buried by the Vesuvian ashes in 79
                A.D., but to a period of more than two hundred years, documenting domestic
                culture during the transition from Late Hellenistic to Imperial Times.
                Consequently, the contexts of decoration were stylistically distinguished.
                However, the motivation to maintain the older decoration, parts of which
                were almost two hundred years old, rather than replacing them with modern
                painting, has not been questioned so far.</p>
            <p>This gap is closed in the presented work by examining the murals' micro-historical
                context. Gradually, a rational strategy becomes apparent in the way the
                ancient house owners would have entire rooms or just certain walls redecorated
                following recent painting trends, at the same time preserving and restoring
                already existing, older decorations and/or merging them with contemporary
                elements to a seemingly harmonious, amalgamated whole.</p>
            <p>As usual the volume includes a detailed catalogue section. All collected
                material which have been the argumentative basis for the assessment of
                the respective context of decoration within a house are compiled here.
                This section would not only exceed the financial conditions of a printed
                publication, but also fragmentary in the long term considering the flood
                of new publication on Campanian antique sites. Therefore, this section
                will be available as an online-Catalogue within the Arachne. The material
                is organized by its location and further by house numbers or rather by
                the modern building name. Information about the decoration of every individual
                room can be found in the corresponding linked records.</p>
