                Since 2015, the Project TehranDigital has started the digitization of the archive of the Tehran Branch of the Eurasia Department of the German Archaeological Institute. A broad amount of documents have been reviewed, described, digitized and, provided with metadata, successively uploaded to idai.objects/Arachne und iDAI.bookbrowser. Enabling the accessibility of the comprehensive collection of archaeological documentation is the primary goal. In addition, the merging and shared processing of data in cooperation with the Iranian partners are focus of the current work.

                <con10t-image src="/con10t/img/teheran_digital/Bild_2.jpg" align="left" width="200">Sites in Iran<br>identified by TehranDigital<br>as of March 2019</con10t-image>
                In its diversity, the great extent of archival documents repeatedly helps to initiate new questions and gives new perspectives on scientific issues. It comprises the presences of german archaeologists in Iran since the earliest works of Ernst Herzfeld in Pasargadae and Persepolis until our most recent investigations, with diaries, sketches, photographic documentation and wide documentations of large scale excavations. Our archaeologists and travellors had documented and photographed the Iranian Cultural Heritage in several decades and in different preservation stages. The veritable wealth of this collection lies in the detailed representation of archaeological artifacts, monuments and landscapes in various states through history. Some of which are no longer existent, caused by excavations, corrosion or erosion, restoration, destruction or archaeological looting.Thus, cultural assets and monuments have changed more or less profoundly over the decades or have even completely disappeared. Therefore, not only the general processing and enabling access to our archive, by means of which we can support or newly develop scientific questions, is the premise of the recent work. Photo documentation of ancient Iranian cultural sites, dating back from the 1930s to the present day, form an important and fundamental basis for the protection of heritage sites and the creation of a catalogue of measures - as currently planned by the Iranian partners. In addition to the outstanding places such as, for example, Persepolis, mainly the numerous documentations of smaller sites and individual monuments such as settlement hills, road stations, bridges, mausoleums, mosques or rock reliefs are testimonies of exploratory trips, repeated over decades. So far, more than 1600 sites have been identified, to which archival documents - often from different years - are available.

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">History</h2>
            <p>
                Long-term excavations of the DAI in Iran in central locations such as Takht-e Soleymān, Zendan-e Soleymān, Bastam, Bīsotūn and Fīrūzābād are of great archaeological and historical significance and have a far-reaching effect beyond the region. They had a lasting effect on today's picture of the Urartian, Achaemenid and Sassanid epochs. Meanwhile Takht-e Soleymān (since 2003) and Bīsotūn (since 2006) are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Recently (2018), the archaeological landscape of the Sassanids in the south of the Fars region with - among others - the round town of Fīrūzābād was inscribed on the list.
            </p>

                All documentation of German activities at these sites is stored in the archive of the Tehran branch, at the Eurasia Department in Berlin. However, the archive of the Tehran not "only" consists of documentation of excavations and surveys. It reflects research performance and areas of interest, the working lives of the employees and directors involved as well as the entire history of the institute.
            </p>
            <p>
                The collection includes correspondence, notes on project ideas, photo series, letters, gypsum copies, drawings (technical drawings such as plans or sketches but also watercolor paintings), contracts, logs, newspaper clippings, map collections, diaries, travel records and research reports - published and unpublished manuscripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Up to now, the processed digital data  comprise approximately 120.000 slides, 17.500 photographs, in form of negatives, positives and/or contact prints, further 4200 photographs and autochrome plates. Approximately 96.000 pages of paper documentation of different formats and materials, form another part of the archive. From recent projects, more informations are available on dozens of CD-ROMs and floppy disks.
            </p>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Objectives and aims</h2>
            <p>
                Metadata are captured for structuring the collection and publishing it on idai.objects / Arachne. Linking the archival documents with the iDAI.gazetteer is another part of the work in order to create a comprehensive visualization of the archive on a digital archaeological map of Iran. Thus, in addition to the (re)location of  specific sites, photos, objects and published data, it is possible to map complete archaeological landscapes, which can be filtered by keywords for specific questions. An additional linking of the sites with the identification number of the Iranian Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization (ICHTO) extends the accessibility for the researchers.

                Almost a fifth of the slides and documents have been digitized since the end of 2015.A main focus of the selection was on the digitization of the extensive archive material, which derives from the years 1971 to 1986, when Dr. Wolfram Kleiss was director of the Teheran branch. In addition, it was greatly enriched by the donation of his private collection. In the same time, most of the map collection was digitized. Furthermore, a focus was set on the documentation of the excavation works on Takht-e Soleymān, where research of the German Archaeological Institute took place from 1959 to 1975 under the direction of Rudolf Naumann and Dietrich Huff.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digitization works also supports new publication projects and compiles new collections of other significant locations such as Bīsotūn or Fīrūzābād. Further, the Tehran Branch is currently working on a reevaluation and publication of the comprehensive research data of the Takht-e Soleymān World Cultural Heritage site. In a mutual cooperation, the Iranian National Museum in Tehran is  opening and processing its archives and collections before and after 1979.
