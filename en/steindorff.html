                The self-reflexion of a discipline is always a reflection of the consciousness of the timedependence of
                scientific research too. The possibility of a substantiated description of historical science cultures
                stands and falls admittedly with suitable, sufficient explicit and complex source-situations. Archive
                documents are not of interest because of their anecdotal statement, the quality always depends much more
                on the possibility of a many-sided view, which allows a control of the studies.
            </p>

            <p>These aspects obtain outstanding importance, if biographies with a good situation of proofs bridge big
                breaks of history. Hardly one biography of an Egyptologist in the 19. – 20. Century is documented and
                suitable to reflect the field of Egyptology from the height of the German Empire, trough the 1. World
                War and the German Revolution, the Weimar Republic, the Nazi-era and the 2. World War to reorganisation
                of the post-war period under the sign of redemocratisation of the western societies and is thereby
                comprehensible in varying roles in a multitude of archives with different characters like the one of
                Georg Steindorff.

            <p>
                Georg Steindorff is born in 1861 in the Duchy of Anhalt to a Jewish family of the middle class in
                Dessau. He evolves into a typical representative of the dynamic pioneers in the time of the Second
                Industrial Revolution in the German Empire and maintains friendly contact with the royal family of
                Saxony. For a membership in the First World War he is already too old. In the Weimar Republic he gains,
                thanks to his role in Egyptology as publisher of the most important professional journal, the
                Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde (ZÄS), and thanks to his close connection with the
                doyen of German Egyptology, Adolf Erman, an inviolable position in the Saxon Academy of Sciences, the
                central management of the German Archeological Institute and the University of Leipzig, of which he is
                principal in 1923/24. Steindorff already converted to Protestantism during his studies in the 80ies of
                the 19. Century, but due to his Jewish origin he soon comes to the fore of the national-socialist race
                ideology. After the employment ban in 1934 and other following repressions, he emigrates to the USA in
                1939.

                Steindorffs diaries and letters always make, besides scientific questions, the political processes in
                Germany and Europe a subject of discussion. Immediately after the end of the war the contact by letter
                to plenty of academic carriers of responsibility in Egyptology in Germany reinstates. The international
                recognized, now 84 year-old Scientist becomes an active commentator of the Nazi-dictatorship and the
                entanglement of individual exponents. At the same time he carefully observes from distance the
                development of his old domain and academy in the soviet-occupied zone and the just founded GDR until his
                death in summer of 1951.

            <p>Steindorffs curriculum vitae is an impressive example for the way of a member of the emancipated Jewish
                middle class, who managed his way to the top of the institutions with his engagement, talent and
                enthusiasm and of whom is no getting around in Egyptology in time before and between the two World Wars.
                His active lecturing activities, also in front of notinternal audiences, today appear as almost modern.
                With the single-minded construction of also this very day’s biggest academic teaching-collection at a
                German university he provided importance to the science-location Leipzig, out of the German borders. The
                same applies for his directional role in conflicts of his generation about the primacy of the
                egyptological methodology and the theory-charged concepts of the 1920ies and 30ies, whose effects are
                disappeared from the awareness today, although they significantly characterized Egyptology in the
                post-war time.

                The importance of this personality is especially documented with his complex heritage of letters. The
                research and publication in ARACHNE was made possible by the donation of the private correspondence of
                Georg Steindorff by his grandson Thomas Hemer to the Leipzig University. Therefore, he owes the biggest
                debt of gratitude. The bundle of archival documents includes more than 6000 single sheets of the years
                1884-1951. The research was made within the project "Wissenshintergründe und Forschungstransfer am
                Beispiel des Ägyptologen Georg Steindorff" from 2013 – 2015 with support from the German Research
                Foundation. The publication of the results will appear in 2016: Susanne Voss und Dietrich Raue (Hgg.),
                Wissenshintergründe und Forschungstransfer am
                Beispiel des Ägyptologen Georg Steindorff, Beihefte der Zeitschrift für Ägyptische Sprache und
                Altertumskunde 3, Berlin: De Gruyter 2016.

                They represent a first step of development, in which contributed, besides the publishers, Alexandra
                Cappel, Thomas Gertzen and Kerstin Seidel. To put the archive online to ARACHNE shall enable a broad
                circle of a scientifically interested audience to work out more research focuses.
