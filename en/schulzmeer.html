            <p>The depictions of sea creatures were omnipresent in the society of the Roman Empire and could be used in many different contexts. Also on Roman marble sarcophagi, figural reliefs with nereids, tritions and other sea creatures that roam the sea together can be observed starting in the early 2nd century. Aside from Dionysian scenes and thiasoi, sea creature depictions are the most common group in ancient sarcophagi. They have been used during the entire time of Roman sarcophagus production until the 4th century and seemed to have been appropriate for pagan and Christian beliefs. The evaluation of the sarcophagi with sea creatures has been diverse from the beginning on and spans from monotonous decoration to images rich in symbolism. </p>
            <p>The depictions on reliefs of representative marble sarcophagi have been rewarding research objects for scientific works. Andreas Rumpf presented depictions of sea creatures as a part of the ASR series in 1939. His catalog with 326 sarcophagi, covers and fragments with sea creatures is supplemented by iconographic investigations on the various creatures as well as first considerations on the meaning of the topic in a funerary context. The main aspect of his research is formed by the take over of Greek models into Roman art. In the following years, the meaning of sea creatures on Roman sarcophagi was controversially discussed.</p>
            <p>The presented catalog lists another 145 unconsidered sarcophagi, covers and fragments. It is a supplement of the previously mentioned dissertation, which is available through the Kölner UniversitätsPublikationsServer (KUPS). This research is a indexing and evaluation of the entire material, reviews the mentioned discourse from a neutral point of view and will by this present a new way to interpret this topic in a funerary context. The catalog is organized into the chronological structure of the work. Precise scene descriptions or superior connections can be selected through the context browser.</p>
