            <p>The project is completed.</p>
            <p>The aim of the project funded by the DFG was the conservation and scientific
                development of the sculpture negatives of the DAI Rome via the ARACHNE
                database.</p>
            <p>As a result, the material has been made available for researchers worldwide
                and free of charge during the years 2004 and 2005 via ARACHNE. This means
                a significant quantitative and qualitative improvement of the material
                basis for studies on ancient scultpure. In addition to the worldwide provision
                of images, the corresponding monuments/objects have been processed for
                complex scientific issues under many combinable criteria.</p>
            <p>The material comprises key complexes of Roman sculptures from Italy. In
                addition to statues and portraits all monuments richly adorned with images
                were recorded, for example the Arch of Titus or the Arch of Constantine
                as well as the Trajan's Column.</p>
