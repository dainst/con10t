            <p>The collections of the Winckelmann-Society and the Winckelmann-Museum in
                Stendal (print graphics, autographs, paintings)</p>
            <p>The Winckelmann-Collection in Arachne is still in progress. The object
                is to make the holdings of the museum available for science. This concerns
                the common object data as well as the image-material, which enables
                uncomplicated photo orders and also a lasting backup of the photo holdings
                in print quality. Due to the special character of the Stendal Museum, which
                is dedicated to the founder of archaeology and art history, the collection
                holdings appear very heterogeneous and can well be subsumed under the
                heading “Reception of Antique and Winckelmann”. The Winckelmann-Society has
                strived to add to the inventory since 1940 and is being assisted by the
                Museum since 1955. The inventory holds drawings, paintings, sculpture,
                antiques, coins and portrait medals as well as autographs and etchings. The
                focus is laid on the few autographs of J. J. Winckelmann, the first
                editions and early prints of his works, as well as the scholar’s portraits.
                The Arachne-database currently holds paintings and drawings of Winckelmann.
                The graphic section containing etchings of antiques as well as views of
                Italy especially from the 18th century (Sadeler, Piranesi, Vasi, Rossini
                etc.) is also available in the Arachne-database. The etchings of
                archaeological and antiquarian literature used by Winckelmann are available
                as well, via the book-browser of Arachne. Of great interest for the
                archaeological research in the Vesuv-cities are the more than 200
                aquarelles of the Presuhn collection showing the excavations from 1874 to
                1881. A small collection of antiquities consisting above all of Greek
                vases, terracottas, bronzes, everyday objects of various categories, coins
                and only a few sculptures, serves to illuminate Winckelmann's research
                topic. The collection is already published and will be merged into Arachne
                shortly. More collection complexes are in progress.</p>
