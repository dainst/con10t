                The Cultural Ministry of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia authorized an innovative archive on the research of ancient sculpture at the University of Cologne on July 9th 1964. The aim of the research institution was to create a dynamic archive with modern technological methods for classical studies. Heinz Kähler was made ordinarius for classical archaeology in 1960 and made the art of the Roman Empire his focus. His assistents in Cologne were Hans Georg Niemeyer and Hansgeorg Oehler that were previous rewarded for their works on ancient sculpture. In this environment the idea of a research institute, „Roman archaeology in a Roman city“ was developed. 50 years of extensive photographic campaigns created one of the largest photo archives for ancient sculpture – today’s  <a href="http://archaeologie.uni-koeln.de/node/23">CoDArchLab</a> - with more than 2 million datasets that are made open to the public through ARACHNE. Under the supervision of Reinhard Förtsch, the image database in the premises of the research archive in Cologne became a digital object database that makes up the core of ARACHNE, having been available online since 2001. For these innovative ideas and the consequent linking of data in a semantic-web, ARACHNE was honored with the

            <p>From October 26th 2014 to December 21st 2014, the exhibition „Antike Plastik 5.0:// – Media of documentation in Archaeology from sketch to 3D model" in the <a href="http://www.antikensammlung.uni-bonn.de">Academic Museum of Art of the University of Bonn</a> covered the influence of various image and documentation media on research on ancient sculpture from the 17th century until today. By using four forms of media, engravings, casts, photos and 3D models, the potential developments of this kind of research are demonstrated. What are the benefits of the respective forms of media and what is their purpose today? The development of documentation methods in classical studies since Clarac and Montfaucon to three-dimensional projections of the NexCave-technology in the 21st century is the focus of attention. Aside from original copper engravings, the museum of the University of Bonn shows numerous photos and historic plaster casts that are compared to the new technology of 3D models.</p>
