            <p>
                Craft production was a key element of pre-modern economies, the workshop acting as an important point of
                intersection between exploitation and daily use of resources (e.g. clay/pottery, stone/architectural
                elements, iron ore/tools). Within the framework of the Research Training Group 1878 »Archaeology of
                pre-modern economies« funded by the DFG, it is aimed to compile craft production sites attested by
                archaeological material as exhaustively as possible. This data base is accessible for free all over the
                world, thus providing an important foundation for further scientific questions and projects as well as
                an overview on essential aspects of the economic and daily life in pre-modern societies for the broader
                public.
            </p>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                All craft production sites included in this project are attested by archaeological finds and/or
                features. The most important information provided in the relevant publications is recorded in the
                specifically adapted framework of the object data base ARACHNE using a standardised vocabulary to
                facilitate search queries, comparisons and analyses on a big scale. Since the publications themselves
                are dispersed, heterogeneous, and often hard to access, this consistent data base should facilitate and
                accelerate research on thematically, chronologically or geographically comprehensive questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshops are contextualised with various technical resources of the German Archaeological Institute
                and the Cologne Digital Archaeology Laboratory to provide additional information for example on relevant
                locations, bibliographic references, deposits of raw material and transport routes. Although the project
                focusses on the Mediterranean in greco-Roman antiquity, it comprises also other cultural regions and
                eras (from Mesoamerica to China, from Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages). Data on further workshops (also
                from other epochs and regions) is added continuously.
            </p>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Project Structure</h2>
            <p>
                The catalog entries were created as Arachne object datasets which were assigned to catalogs
                according to the type of material groups and the culture groups. Clicking on a folder icon will
                display any subfolders or records relating to the individual workshops, with detailed information on
                these structures being accessible directly via the link. In addition, you can always use the magnifying
                glass icon on the right to show all records that are subordinate to that folder.
                <br>
                In the results view on the second level (reachable by the link above the map "Show all datasets"), the
                different facets offer the possibility to further filter and combine with each other of the records
                according to certain criteria (eg, picture(s) available, location, literature, more accurate dating,
                etc). To go back to the catalogs from a selected data record, click on the link with the corresponding
                catalog entry.
                <br>
                In addition, you can search for specific terms in the project data records, display all entries of
                the project or use the cartographic search option of all recorded and georeferenced workshop sites.
                Furthermore the search option with the map has all available filters for you to use.
