            The “Römische Mitteilungen” of the German Archaeological Institute is an annual, peer-reviewed journal. Since 1829 the journal and its predecessor, the “Bullettino dell’Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica”, have promoted an international scholarly discourse on the archaeology, art, and architecture of the ancient cultures of the Italic peninsula and surrounding regions. It serves as a platform for presenting and debating the material culture from Prehistory to the Early Middle Ages, with a traditional emphasis on Classical Antiquity.</p>
            <p>We invite submissions of short or medium-sized manuscripts in German, English, Italian, and French ranging from synthetic articles to excavation reports. Manuscripts may be submitted at any time and should follow the guidelines of the German Archaeological Institute, aiming at the highest possible quality in the documentation of the material.</p>
