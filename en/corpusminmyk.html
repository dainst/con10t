            <p>The Corpus of Minoan and Mycenaean Seals (CMS) has been published
                exclusively in a printed version since being established in 1958. The
                project’s aim is the scholarly publication of every preserved seal and clay
                cast from the Aegean Bronze Age. Most of the Corpus should be digitized,
                updated and available on the internet for free before the project ends in
                2011. The final volume CMS XIV, which contains the typology that is essential
                to the project, is already in progress and the index of the entire work,
                including summaries of the most important themes of the seal research, will
                be developed comprehensively.</p>

            <p>The project is conducted in cooperation with the Academz of Sciences and Literature in Mainz and the Academic Workplace "Corpus of Minonan and Mycenaean Seals" in Marburg under the scientific supervision of the Commission for Archaeology of the Mainz Academy.</p>
            <p>The Corpus of Minonan and Mycenaean Seals has been established in 1958 and so far only been pulished in a print version, which aims at a scientific evaluation of all seals from the Aegaean Bronze Age and their impressions in clay and are to be digitized, updated and accessible for free online bz the end of 2011.The final volume CMS XIV, which contains the typology that is essential to the project, is already in progress and the index of the entire work, including summaries of the most important themes of the seal research, will be developed comprehensively. The CMS is also focused on sustainablity, migration and completion into a modern and internationally well visible information network in Classical Archaeology *Arachne* and shall be integrated into it in order to secure the research perspectives of the material by the adding of new finds and the opening of new research ideas.</p>
            <p>The project is being conducted with support of the German Research Foundation.</p><img src="/con10t/img/corpusminmyk/DFG_zweizeilig_blau_1.jpg"
