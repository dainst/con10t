            <p>The volumes of the series called "Palilia" existing since 1997 of the
                Rome Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI) are not only
                impressive on account of their excellent readability but also their handy
                size. In order to guarantee this continuously and to allow the publication
                of works based on extensive documentation of archaeological material at the
                same time, CoDArchLab and the DAI Rome are treading a new path of
                archaeological publication: Supplementation of printed works by digital
                provision of additional materials using the adapted book structure. The
                volumes of the Palilia-series themselves are independent and completely
                comprehensible in their reasoning. At the same time they are also readable
                and manageable. Readers who want to see details of the material are invited
                to take a look at the catalogs of each volume available in Arachne. On
                this page you get to the individual supplements of the Palilia-volumes.</p>
