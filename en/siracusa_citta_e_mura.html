            The extensive city walls that were built by Dionysos I after the haunting events of the war with Athens, were to protect the Epipole plateau, which had a direct view over the city of Syracuse and together with the Castello Eurialo, formed the largest fortification system of the ancient world. The historian Diodorus Siculus vividly describes the walls in his works. After the rediscovery of antiquity in the Renaissance, the walls have been a key monument for the historic cityscape, even after the inhabited area was reduced to the island of Ortigia. This picture of the great Syracuse remained in place until modernity and continued to shape the perception of the monument within the urban context of today’s city. This also led to the first investigation on the Castello Eurialo. The scientific groundwork for needed means of renovations and restorations were preceded by topographical and archaeological research.
