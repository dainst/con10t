            <p>The catalog of architectural remains presents especially archaeological
                records to the castra praetoria, the castra peregrina and to the castra
                nova equitum singularium. The remained troops' accommodations are poorly
                preserved or only represented by a few entries. It's because in many cases
                there is no excavation report or they were not accessible. The catalog
                considers the finds and findings which originate from the area of each
                camp as well as from the immediate surroundings.</p>
            <p>The surrounding defence of the castra praetoria is only described accurately,
                when peculiarities were discovered during the object's survey and if not
                mentioned in the detailed description of Lucos Cozza (Cozza, Mura). The
                altitudes given in the catalog texts refer to the respective run level
                at the time of excavation. The original run level often can not be reconstructed
                to an absolute height because the natural course of the terrain within
                the camp is uncertain and the referenced altitudes as well as the calculated
                daily heights are lacking.</p>
            <p>The associated finds are attached to the relevant archaeological records.</p>
            <p>The catalog numbers follow a fixed numbering scheme, which is composed
                of an abbreviation for the particular camp and of two numbers separated
                by a dot (eg CP 1.14). The first number represents the feature category
                (1 = surrounding defense), the second for the actual finding (14 = finding).
                In this way the feature numbers can be clearly distinguished from the catalog
                numbers of the funerary monuments.</p>
            <p>Abbreviation of urban roman camps:
                <br>CP = castra praetoria
                <br>CPE = castra peregrina
                <br>CPES = castra priora equitum singularium
                <br>CNES = castra nova equitum singularium
                <br>SCV = stationes cohortium vigilum
                <br>ECV = excubitoria cohortium vigilum</p>
            <p>Categories of findings:
                <br>1 = Surrounding defence
                <br>2 = Building
                <br>3 = Infrastructure
                <br>4 = Not determinable findings
                <br>5 = Findings with no longer known exact location
                <br>6 = Findings surrounding the camp</p>

            <p>All records of the catalog are currently available via the 'Metasearch'
                as well as via the 'extended search'. The links of the catalogs to the
                respective records are presently in process.</p>
