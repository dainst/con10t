            <p>For over 50 years, archaeological research in Africa has been done at the Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology at the University of Cologne. In addition to the rock art research started in Namibia in 1963, Northeastern Africa established itself as a second focus region in the early 1980s - both areas that had been largely "terra incognita" of prehistoric research until then.
            <br/>
            The focus of the various projects (including the DFG projects
            <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/sfb389/staff/lenssen-erz/e_lenssen_erz_projekte.html#1" target="_blank">Rock Art in the higher Brandberg</a>,
            <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/hbi/Texte/BOS_Bericht03.pdf" target="_blank">B.O.S.</a> and
            <a href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/sfb389/" target="_blank">SFB 389 ACACIA</a>) in addition to the rock art was especially on human-environment relationships.
            </p>
            <p>The long tradition of Cologne Africa research manifests itself not only in manifold / a large number of publications but also in an extensive collection of finds, slides, drawings and texts. These are located in the
            <a href="http://www.fstafrika.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/" target="_blank">Forschungsstelle Afrika</a>
            which has existed since 1986 at the Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology of the University of Cologne.
            </p>
            <p>Since 2012, the African Archaeology Archive Cologne (AAArC) has made it its mission to digitize the archives and documentation available there and make it available in the object database
            <a href="http://arachne.uni-koeln.de/" target="_blank">ARACHNE</a>.
            Meanwhile, large parts of the inventories have already been digitized and are available online, the deeper exploration and contextualization of the objects represented in ARACHNE is expected in the course of the coming years.
            </p>
            <p>The project gets funded by the <a href="http://www.dfg.de/" target="_blank">German Research Foundation</a>.
