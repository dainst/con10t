                <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Introduction to the online publication</h2>

                <p>The online catalog presented here is based on around 5.400 fragments of figural terracottas and small-sized objects of fired loam, of which the objects 1-1030 were selected. Most fragments, except for a few exceptions, come from the residential area of Pergamon and were found during the so-called city excavation (1973-1993). The excavated area is located on the southern slope of the acropolis of Pergamon, directly above the sanctuary of Demeter, the Heraion and the gymnasium complexes. It seems that only few objects can be dated into the Archaic and Classical period of Pergamon, the largest part is from the Hellenistic era and the Roman Empire. Almost no clay figurines and objects are preserved from the long Byzantine phase of use.</p>

                <p>The terracottas that were found in the city excavation are representative of their topic and also in their numerical relation to each other and coherent with what has been known from previous excavations. New objects could be added to most topics (mother of gods, Aphrodite, Eros, Heracles, masks, etc.) that were not known before. The significance of other types could be proven. Certain types or topics were identified for the first time (Men in the form of two clay moulds, Eros 517, a number of high quality heads of children). The dense network of connections could be increased. It is also the aim of the work to create a basis for future research on Pergamene coroplastics.</p>

                <p>No secure assumptions can be made on the use of the terracottas of the city excavation. The contexts of use can be that could be relevant are small and large residential building, collegia, a identified Heroon (the so-called Megalesion and the so-called Hestiaion), shops and smaller workshops.</p>

                <p>A small part of the terracottas from the city excavation is not included in the work: those were the already published by H. Schwarzer from the so-called Podiensaalgebäude (a building for a Dionysian collegium – there a series of interesting figurine fragments was found). Selected pieces that were found in building Z, not being that many, were included into the catalog. The 40 finds from the peristyle house at the southwestern edge of the city excavation are to be published separately. Sarah Japp is working on the relevant terracottas. All of the other fragments were already archived as a part of the selection process for the catalog. Heads of figures that were preserved too badly and thus not identifiable (ca. 130 objects), unidentifiable figure fragments (ca. 800 objects), fragments of arms and hands, legs and feet (ca. 390 objects) could not be included into the catalog. Among the roughly 900 very small fragments of clothing, only 19 fragments could be found that presented stylistically or technically relevant peculiarities.  Most of the terracottas from the city excavation are stored in the depots of the Pergamon excavation. A small part (ca. 250 pieces) is stored in the Archaeological Museum of Bergama.</p>

                <p>From the start page, you have three options to get to the cataloged objects with pictures.

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you click "Show all datasets" under <strong>"Browse project data"</strong> you will be directed to the results that include all objects investigated by S. Kielau. In the results, you can filter them further according to certain categories (f. e. with pictures)and also display the result list in a list, map or icon view. You can also search directly through the search bar "Search project".

                        <br>
                        
                        <li>Through the <strong>catalog view on the top </strong> you can also navigate in the iconographically structured catalog. Through clicking the folder symbol, subordinate catalog datasets are shown. Additionally, you can always make all subordinate datasets visible in the result view by clicking the magnifying glass.</li>
                        <br>

                        <li>Through the link on top "directly to catalog" you will reach the <strong>overview of the catalog</strong>. Here, you can navigate through the catalog structure on the left side. If you click on one of the cataloged datasets of S. Kielau, the respective Arachne dataset will be displayed.
