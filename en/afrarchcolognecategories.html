                    The Arabic Repulic of Egypt covers a surface of more than a million square kilometers in northeastern Africa. The Nile River forms the main axis of the country, creating a up to 25 km broad river oasis, which is broadens to a 23,000 square km river delta. Deserts dominate the landscape east and west of the Nile: in the west the Libyan desert, a vast shield landscape that is interrupted by basins and lowlands of oases; in the east the Arabian deserts, which is dominated by mountain ranges that are crossed by wadis. Deserts, semin-deserts and the river oasis of the Nile characterize the ecological conditions.

                    Several scientific investigation show drastic climatological transitions with a change from a humid to an arid phase during the last 10,000 years. Research in the fields of archaeology and earth scienes are manifold n Egypt but for a long time focused on the Nile valley, Research of the University of Cologne began in the Libyan desert in the 1980s with the DFG-research project B. O. S. (settlement history in the eastern Sahara). Special research area (SFB) 389 ACACIA (1995-2007) followed the project with works on project parts A1 and E3. Other projects that were also funded by the DFG, such as "Chufu 01/01" (2006-2009) and "Wadi Sura" (since 2009) resumed the research. Investigation in the fields of archaeology and earth sciences are conducted within the SFB 806, project part A1.A

                         The People's Democratic Republic of Algeria is the largest country in Africa with a surface area of roughly 2.4 million square kilometers. The Atlas mountain range lies in the northern part of the country, south of that the Sahara follows that covers around 85% of the country, In addition to these sand dune areas, the stepped landscape of the Tassili n'Ajjer and the Ahaggar mountain range can be found there. Aside from the mediterranean coast, Algeria's ecological climate can be described as arid or semi-arid. Several scientific investigations show clear climatological changes with a transition from a humid to an arid phase during the last 10,000 years. The mountainous landscapes of Algeria have mostly been known for its richness in prehistoric rock art since the 1950s. The Tassili n'Ajjer mountains were added as an UNESCO world heritage site in the area of cultural and natural heritage in 1982.

                         Within the study programm Culture and Environment in Africa (CEA) of the University of Cologne, a Master thesis was written by Issak Cheikh Oukafi treating the rock art fund in the Tassili n'Ajjer, using ethnoarchaeological approaches. This categories features all data that have been recorded in Algeria.

                    The Republic of Chad is a landlocked country in central Africa. Around 90% of the country are covered by the eastern Chad basin with Lake Chad. The Ennedi plateau and the Ouaddaï highlands are in the east of the country, in the north the volcanic Tibesti mountains as well as the Erdi Ma plateau. Deserts, semi-deserts and savannahs dominate the ecological conditions. Several scientific investigations show clear climatological changes with a transition from a humid to an arid phase during the last 10,000 years.

                    Research in the fields of archaeology and earth sciences in Chad by the University of Cologne started as a part of the special research area (SFB) 380 ACACIA, namely the projects A6 (2002-2007) and A8 (2005-2007). Since 2009 more research in earth sciences is continued as a part of SFB 806, project A2.

                    Several scientific investigations show clear climatological changes with a transition from a humid to an arid phase during the last 10,000 years. Research in the fields of archaeology and earth sciences has only been conducted in few instances from the University of Cologne. Rock art in the Fezzan was documented, as a part of the special research area (SFB) 389 ACACIA (1995-2007) some research was conducted as a part of the project A1. Further archaeological investigation were made by the Heinrich-Barth-Institute e.V. in the southeast (Jebel Ouenat, 2005) and in the center of the country (Jebel Haruj, 2008).

                    The Republic of Namibia is a coastal state in southern Africa. The 825,000 square km of the country are divided into a hyperarid coastline of the Namib desert and the Skeleton Coast, the Great Escarpment as well as the inner highlands that continue into the arid Kalahari basin. Emphemere omiramba that direct water away from the highlands, made this the preferred settlement region.
                    <br>
                    The Cologne University has had a long tradtion in the research of African rock art since professor Herbert Kühn published an illustrated book about "Buschmann Kunst" in 1930 together with H. Obermeier. This publication was the first to present a rock painting newly discovered by Reinhard Maack in Namibia. The image was later popularized by the prehistorian Abbé Henri Breuil as "the White Lady of the Brandberg", who was later shown further rock art sites in Namibia by Ernst Scherz. In 1963, Scherz's interest eventually led to a research project that would funded by the DFG and conducted by Cologne's Instute for Prehistory (with Africa Studies and Ethnology). The institute was able to secure the scientific oversight for this and following projects, first by Herman Schwabedissen and later by Rudolph Kuper. 
                    <br>
                    The project that was begun in 1963 went on without a break until 2006. Highly relevant contributions to the archaeology of Namibia were accomplished by the project and others that were right aside it: Wolfgang Wendt found the old African piece of art in the Apollo 11 grotto in southern Namibia, which is dated to an age of around 30,000 years; Ernst Scherz (with Anneliese Scherz) started a country wide documentation of Namibian rock art; Harald Pager recorded rock art from the Brandberg/Daureb with astonishing detail and precision; Peter Breunig conducted many excavations at the Brandberg/Daureb and could date rock art to an age of 2700 years; Jürgen Richter excavated in central Africa and published it with older excavations of W. Wendt; Ralf Vogelsang worked in the SFB 686 ACACIA and by conducting excavations in northern Namibia together with Barbara Eichhorn contributed a lot to the archaeology of the Later Stone Age in the Kaoko region; Eileen Kose excavated and published Iron Age sites near the Kavango River; a team led by Tilman Lenssen-Erz published six comprehensive catalogs with Harlad Pager's rock art documentation; thousands of documentation records of Harald Pager that were in Cologne for the publication, were given to Namibia's national archive.
                    <br>    
                    After 2000 the engagement of the University of Cologne focused on cooperation with the University of Namibia, especially Goodman Gwasira and also on training for members of local communities, such as the Daureb Mountain Guides.
