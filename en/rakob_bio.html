            <div>
                <p>Friedrich Rakob studied Architecture and Building History in Munich and Karlsruhe from 1952 to 1958. During his studies, he conducted historical architectural investigations in Italy together with Arnold Tschira and Walter-Herwig Schuchardt. He was appointed as an architectural historian at the German Archaeological Institute in Rome in 1962 and took up a DAI travel grant just one year later. He was awarded his PhD in 1967 for a thesis on The Piazza d’Oro in Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli.
                    It was probably during his travel grant that Rakob discovered his interest in the Maghreb as he made his way to Libya and Tunisia, among other countries. From then onwards, the focus of his research would shift from Italy to North Africa and in particular to Northern Tunisia.</p>
                <p>He began to research the spring santcuary at Djebel Zaghouan in Tunisia in 1964 and continued this research from 1968 as director of the major excavations in Chimtou/Simitthus, conducted in collaboration with the National Institute for Archaeology and Art (INAA). Parallel to the project in Chimtou/Simitthus, Rakob led the major German excavations in Quartier Magon in the coastal area of Carthage from 1974 onwards. In addition to Rakob’s main projects, his path also took him to other settlements in North Africa, in particular Siga and Lambaesis in Northern Algeria, and to Italy – including Rome, Baiae and Palestrina. At these sites, he investigated different aspects of urban structure, urban development and architecture, which he published in scholarly articles.</p>
                <p>Friedrich Rakob retired in 1996. He continued to work on his excavation materials and to organise them until his death in 2007 in Münster, near to his birthplace, Ennigloh in North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>

                <p>Friedrich Rakob worked in Chimtou, the ancient town of <a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/entity/2848" target="_blank">Simitthus</a>, from 1968 to 1996. Chimtou/Simitthus is located in North-Western Tunisia near the border with Algeria. It is situated near and on the summit of Djebel Chimtou beside the Bagradas/Medjerda River, giving it a strategically favourable position. Simitthus was originally a Numidian settlement. The popular <a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/entity/1167243" target="_blank">Giallo antico bzw. Marmor numidicum</a> (Numidian marble), was excavated there as far back as the time of King Micipsa (148-118 BC). After the former Numidian territory was incorporated into the province Africa Proconsularis as Africa Nova under Augustus, the quarries of Colonia Julia Augusta Numidica Simithu became a possession of the Roman Empire. Large quantities of the yellow marble were then exported via the harbour of Tabarka and used as a decorative construction material in the Roman Empire, in particular in Rome itself. Following a series of historic events, including the revolt of Gordian I and Gordian II and the disbanding of Legio III Augusta in the third century AD, the imperial administration allowed the town to fall. The production sites were also abandoned shortly afterwards. The settlement of Simitthus continued into the Fatimid period (11th century).</p>

                <p>Measurements were taken in 1965, and prospection began on Djebel Chimtou in the following year, led by Theodor Kraus and Josef Röder. These investigations focused on the extraction and processing of giallo antico (and the associated labour and organisational camp). The German-Tunisian team led by Azedine Beschaouch and Mustapha Khanoussi, both long-standing co-directors of the excavations alongside Friedrich Rakob, together with Christoph B. Rüger, Jan-Martin Klessing, Ulrike Hess, Mercedes Vegas and other colleagues, worked on the archaeological sites until the mid-1990s. Planning for the marble museum in Chimtou began in 1990, and work on the museum itself started in 1991. The excavation site was also restored.
                Rakob edited the first of five volumes on Simitthus, which were published collaboratively by the DAI and the INAA/INP (National Heritage Institute). The fifth volume appeared in 2017 and was edited by Ulrike Hess.
                The DAI resumed its activities in Chimtou in 2008 directed by Philipp von Rummel.</p>

                <p>Parallel to the Chimtou/Simitthus project, Rakob led the major German excavations in <a href="  https://gazetteer.dainst.org/place/2734102 " target="_blank">Quartier Magon</a> in the coastal area of Carthage from 1974 to 1996. He worked with almost exactly the same team as in Chimtou/Simitthus. At times in its history, Carthage was a large and influential city. Today it is a suburb of Tunis, where villas are predominantly located right on the Gulf of Tunis, which opens out onto the Mediterranean. This location offered many advantages for both trade and the city’s defence on land and at sea. The Punic Qart Hadasht (= ‘new city’, later Carthage) was founded by seafarers from Phoenician Tyre in the late ninth century BC and grew to become a densely populated city in just a short time.
                    Between the sixth and fourth century BC, Carthage extended its sphere of influence. It fought the Etruscans and the Greeks for supremacy in the Mediterranean Basin after it expanded its sphere of influence to include Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica. The conflicts continued in the third century BC with the three Punic Wars with Rome. Carthage was destroyed under the Roman flag in 146 BC, with the intention being that it would never be settled again.However, the city was rebuilt roughly one hundred years later as Colonia Julia Carthago under Caesar and Augustus. As the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius ordered the construction of major buildings, Carthage blossomed again and was the third-largest city in the Roman Empire in the second century AD.
                    Carthage quickly assumed great significance in late antiquity as an important episcopal see. In the fifth and early sixth century, Carthage was the capital of the Vandal Kingdom. From 533, the city was the capital of Byzantine Africa until it was conquered by the Arabs at the end of the seventh century during the Islamic expansion. Carthage, once an important economic centre in North Africa, saw its importance decline as the newly founded city of Tunis rose to prominence..</p>
                <p>The first excavations and research projects in Carthage were conducted from the mid-19th century onwards and continued until the early 20th century (led by Charles Ernest Beulé, Alfred Louis Delattre and Paul Gauckler, among others). However, the first systematically planned major excavations only began in 1974 as part of the UNESCO Save Carthage campaign <a href="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/000407491" target="_blank">‚Pour le sauvegarde de Carthage’</a>, in which twelve countries participated. On the German side, Friedrich Rakob took part in the excavations in the Quartier Magon, in cooperation with the INAA/INP. The history of the city’s development was recorded, from the early Punic period to the early Byzantine period. In 1984, the Quartier Magon was inaugurated as an archaeological park with a small museum. Surveys began in Rue Ibn Chabâat in the same year. They were combined into a major project from 1988, and the second archaeological park was inaugurated in Rue Ibn Chabâat, under the name of Quarter Didon, in 2017. Recent members of the team working on the excavations, investigations and restorations include Ralf Bockmann, Stefan Fleig, Moncef Hamaida and Jan-Martin Klessing, as well as Christof Flügel and Heimo Dolenz, who continued research on the findings after the end of the actual excavations from 2009 to 2012 and published the fourth volume in the Carthage series in 2012; a fifth volume is in progress</p>
