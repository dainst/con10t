The‘Neolithic Revolution’ in Southwest Asia saw the emergence of large, settled communities which, as it now appears, 
defined themselves in terms of architecture and sculptured representations – ‘our place’. Göbekli Tepe in Southeast Turkey
 is one of several 12,000-year-old sites currently producing evidence for monumental structures and a rich symbolism, both 
 of which present a whole new challenge to archaeologists working in this exciting field; presently, we think that these Early
 Neolithic societies defined themselves in relation to a cosmos – ‘our place in the world’.</p>

	
</a> The purpose of this research has been to identify innovative theoretical approaches to investigate how these first large, 
permanently co-resident communities functioned, and how and why they networked with each other as they did. It perhaps goes without
 saying that the unique site of Göbekli Tepe is central to this undertaking, it having produced overwhelming examples of monumental
 ritual enclosures, decorated T-pillars, sculptures and small objects of art, some of which it shares in common with a small number
 of coeval (10th and 9th millennia calBC) sites in the Upper Mesopotamian region. Indeed, the site’s excavator, Klaus Schmidt, once
 stated that this was no ‘ordinary’ settlement site, but what appeared to be a ‘meeting place’ and ‘ritual centre’ erected by complex
 hunter-gatherers. It was only in the course of several subsequent transformation processes that crop cultivation and animal husbandry
 would eventually evolve. It follows that questions relating to symbolism and incipient religion, as well as the social structures of
 these Early Neolithic societies, are central to our research project.</p>
 
<p>In contrast, a second part of the project is dedicated to the analysis of new radiocarbon data from Göbekli Tepe. It is hoped that these
 newly acquired data will shed more light on aspects of site-internal chronologies, in particular the temporal sequence of the monumental 
 enclosures, thus with clear implications for interpretation.</p>
<p>The fact that these communities were able to create powerful and impressive architecture and striking visual symbolism must, in itself, 
provide us with some information about how they framed their ideas of who they were, how they related to one another, and how they stood in
 relation to their idea of their world. Certainly, new archaeological discoveries made in the last twenty years have imparted unprecedented
 insights into the spirituality and religious thoughts of Early Neolithic hunter-gatherer societies. 
									
<p>In summary, this project is bringing together

 a collective of internationally renowned specialists from quite diverse scientific disciplines.									
 In addition to leading archaeologists, including the directors of the most important Early Neolithic sites in the Ancient Near East, members of
 this group include scientists working in the fields of comparative religion, architecture and art theory, cognitive and evolutionary psychology,
 as well as sociologists and ethnologists. A first workshop in Istanbul and Şanlıurfa back in October 2012 saw seeds sown for first collaborations
 between these scientists. Additionally, this meeting culminated in the compilation of a catalogue of relevant research questions relating to Early
 Neolithic symbolism and social structures. A second workshop, with a slightly modified circle of scientists, followed at the ICAANE in Basel in Jun
e 2014, and a further symposium held in September 2014, again in Şanlıurfa, focussed on the role of the Upper Mesopotamian region in the Neolithisation
 process.</p>
<p>The project will culminate in a final conference to be held in Berlin at the end of 2015, the proceedings of which should be published in the
 following year. This meeting will consider the social, cultural, economic and environmental processes at work in the Epi-Palaeolithic and Early Neolithic
 periods in Southwest Asia. It will also focus on the work undertaken at other sites in Southeast Turkey and northern Syria, and will include
 contributions from the aforementioned specialists in the non-archaeological disciplines.</p>
<p>Finally, in addition to a series of new scientific contributions, it is also planned to produce a slim, colour-illustrated, popular publication,
 in which results from our research shall be made available to a much wider (non-specialist) audience.
