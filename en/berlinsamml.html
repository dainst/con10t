            <p>As part of the cooperative project Das Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk,
                every plaster cast in Berlin (from Freie Universität, Humboldt-Universität,
                and the Antikensammlung/State Museums of Berlin) representing an ancient
                object was systematically recorded and entered into ARACHNE. This work took
                place at Freie Universität Berlin between 2009 and 2012.</p>
            <p>The Cast Collection in Berlin has a long and eventful history. The first
                collection of plaster casts was established here as early as 1696. Although
                first housed in the Academy of Art, in 1855 the casts occupied the entire
                first floor and staircase of the Neues Museum on Berlin’s Museum Island. In
                1921 the collection was moved to a new display venue in the university
                (today the Humboldt-Universität). At that time, comprising around 2,500
                objects, this collection was one of the largest in the world. Damage
                inflicted in the Second World War and the following decades considerably
                eroded and finally destroyed the original collection for the most part.</p>
            <p>In West Berlin, the Cast Collection of Ancient Sculpture of Freie
                Universität was eventually reconstituted and, in 1988, opened in
                Charlottenburg. A part of the old Berlin collection was also opened to the
                public in the Humboldt-Universität after 1990.</p>
            <p>In concert with the Skulpturennetzwerk project, every plaster cast (from
                Freie Universität, Humboldt-Universität, and the Antikensammlung/State
                Museums of Berlin) was recorded and incorporated in ARACHNE. In addition to
                data like provenance, state of preservation, and relevant bibliography,
                extant photographs too were digitized.</p>
            <p>Plaster casts today represent an essential medium for archaeological
                research and teaching. By including the Berlin collection of approximately
                3500 casts, Das Berliner Skulpturennetzwerk has achieved a considerable
                increase in the accessibility of extant searchable objects.</p>
            <p>Conclusion of the project: September 2012</p>
