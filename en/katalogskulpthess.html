            <p>In the Department of Archaeology of the Aristotle University of
                Thessaloniki a research group of PhD candidates and graduate students was
                formed in 1991 under the supervision of Professors G. Despinis, Th.
                Stefanidou- Tiveriou and Emm. Boutiras. The group has been working since
                then on the research project of development of the photographic archive of
                sculptures kept in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. The
                Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki keeps sculptures dating from the
                archaic to the late imperial period and found mainly in the area from
                various regions of Macedonia and Thrace. This archive is used for the
                publication of the sculptures of the Museum. Until today only the first
                volume has been published: G. Despinis, Th. Stefanidou- Tiveriou, Emm.
                Boutiras, List of sculptures of the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki
                (1997). The second volume in which a bigger number of writers participate
                is in press, while the material that will constitute the third volume of
                series has already been collected. The archive holds currently over 3.200
                photographs.</p>
            <p>Arachne is used to mirror that archive and to update it with further
                volumes.</p>
