The largest group is that of Imperial portraits with more than 12,000 sculptures. Portraits on funerary reliefs, sarcophagi and historic reliefs are in part of the respective subcategories.

With more than 10,000 photographs, Roman reliefs are the largest category among the reliefs. Greek reliefs are also well represented with ca. 2,500 photos. Historical reliefs are part of the category „figural architectural decor“.

The wall paintings from Rome are divided into topographical and chronological units (f. e. 1st-2nd century). Greek paintings also mention the material of the painting (f. e. stelai, sarcophagi, ivory). The majority of depictions of ancient paintings is found among the 4,000 pictures of Pompeian wall paintings.
