            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The photographical stocks held by the head office at Berlin reflect the
                importance of its role within the overall structure of the DAI over the
                last hundred years. Support to the scientific community through the management
                of libraries, archives and the coordination of publications was always
                regarded as of great a concern as the research done by the academic staff.
                In contrast to the departments abroad the stocks have not come from campaigns
                for photographs and systematic collecting.
            </p>

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>
                A systematic photo library was installed in the 1980s mainly for the purpose
                of integrating the scholarly archive and material from casual donations.
                As a consequence, the content varies widely, but there are a reasonable
                number of images on vase painting, sculpture, lamps and topography. Among
                the scholarly bequests are those of Th. Wiegand, O. Reuther, F. Noack,
                B. Schweitzer, G. Loeschke, A. Schiff, K. Ronczewski. Around 13 700 prints
                have been catalogued and made accessible via a systematic index.
            </p>

            <h3>Access</h3>
            <p>Due to organizational reasons, the use of the photo archive is possible
                only as part of the use of the library. Access by appointment only. Large
                parts of the photographic material from the scholarly bequests have been
                made accessible online via the Arachne database.
            </p>

            <h3>Services</h3>
            <p>
                Prints or scans can be applied for via email. In
                Arachne there is also the possibility of ordering reproductions of the
                images displayed. Services and fees are based mainly on the DAI's mission
                to support scholarly research, according to the DAI's guidelines for photographic
                services. In general, the use of these images is strictly bound by the
