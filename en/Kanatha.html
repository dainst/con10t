            <h1>Summary</h1>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">1. Kanatha in pre-Roman times</h2>

            <p>Kanatha shows a long tradition of settlement that was due to a favorable position between the pasture and farming land, fertile soils and rich resources of water. The beginnings reach into the early Bronze Age or even earlier. Up to this day, prehistoric research has not been conducted but prospections in Auranitis and Bosra could identify traces of settlements dating into the second millennium BC. The oldest known stone monuments in Kanatha and Seeia are funerary constructions and temenos walls of sanctuaries whose megalithic and polygonal building techniques suggest a tradition of Iron Age masonry thus making it possible to be dated into pre-Hellenistic times. For a long time, the existential livelihood came from farming and raising livestock that also influenced the appearance of settlements and the lives of their inhabitants. They were mostly farmers, farming hands and bondsmen who answered to masters that were the heads of several clans. In Hellenistic times, the region of Auranitis came under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. By this, the region got a new administrative organization but internal clan structures with special religious and private arrangements continued to be in place.</p>
            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">2.  Political reorganization in the eastern Mediterranean by the establishment of the province of Syria</h2>

            <p>After the establishment of the Roman province of Syria a renewed overlapping of the traditional culture became evident when modern, technical and formal standards of the Hellenistic-Roman city structure were superimposed on the region. It was the largest proven urbanistic transformation in Kanatha. The political upgrading to a “city” with a largely autonomous administration did not only cause the monumentalization of the settlement but also the new quality of the infrastructure. 
            <br>
            During Roman rule, Kanatha like most settlements in the eastern Mediterranean was far from having the constitution of a Greek polis. The general societal structure was not divided into social classes defined by a legal status. On the one hand there was the powerful clergy that defined their position and rule by being part of certain families. In their roles as priests, merchants, landowners and official in one they largely shaped public life in Kanatha. Local elites ruled over the people and were only subordinated to the representatives of the Ptolemaic dynasty or the governors of the province in Roman times by holding all of the important positions in one. On the other side, there is a large amount of people without a proper legal status that worked for their masters and thus earned their livelihood. These local dynasties were in turn responsible for the well-being of their subordinates. 
            <br>
            In an urbanistic sense, one could not call the city a polis either. Compared to Greek cities, these places lacked political buildings such as the Bouleuterion and squares like an Agora. The largest places of communication were sanctuaries that made up the field of interaction of religious, political, economic and social proceedings that were all intertwined with each other. The orientation on Greek models is recognizable yet they were only partly adopted and altered to local needs. This was especially seen in living quarters in Kanatha and the Auranitis. Elaborate houses show the prestige of their owners in the representative rooms whereas the rather simple agricultural estates reflect the more functional needs of the owners. This makes residential buildings in southern Syria diametrally different from Italic city villas and luxurious residences whose furnishings and collections of art show the Dionysian enjoyment of life and the Greek educational idea of the owners.</p>

            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">3. Self-representation and the definition of political actors</h2>

            <p>
                The political upgrading of Kanatha made the local elites feel the need to define and present themselves in a new manner. On the one hand, they saw themselves in the role of the successor of the rulers of the Hellenistic kingdoms, on the other hand they also felt associated to the Roman world by the new political order. This process caused another expansion of the city whose buildings exceeded the previous Hellenistic ones in size and luxury. The new appearance was meant to give the political actors a more pronounced position. Especially Hellenistic and Roman models were taken up and altered to the local culture. Adapting foreign cultural goods is connected to the intention of formally upvalueing own material products while keeping the traditional form of live intact for the most part. No other monuments show this more openly than sacral and residential buildings. The former were monumentalized and decorated with ornaments of Hellenistic and Roman tradition but kept all of the structures that were necessary for the inhabitants to continue the worship of local gods and their ancient cultic practices. The renovation of sanctuaries was thus not connected to new religious necessities but shaped by the desire to retain their traditional gods in the temples whose architectural appearance was equal or even superior to other centers in the Mediterranean. Several residential buildings whose layout and furnishings were still adapted to a private lifestyle and the work needs of inhabitants that worked in agriculture also show an outer appearance of monumental scale. 
                <br>The generally higher standard of living in the city is manifested in the development of a new infrastructure, which was focused on an improved road network and water supply systems.</p>
            <h2>4. Financing of the buildings</h2>

            <p>The question on the funding arises when thinking about the expensive and elaborate luxury buildings. No reference to funding from the Imperial budget or the province’s administration has been found in the numerous inscriptions from Kanatha or the Hauran. Local officials are mentioned as initiators and funders that were likely heads of larger clans. The magistrates mentioned in the inscriptions quite often could be considered to be less of a benefactor but rather the official overlooking the construction. Just in few instances, public buildings were financed by a single person, as seems to be the case for the temple of Baalschamin in Seeia. The large public buildings were funded by several local officials as can be seen from the donation of the columns of the “Peripteraltemple” and the temple of Zeus Megistos in Kanatha. The family of a councilman in Kanatha donated the porch of the early Imperial temple in the sanctuary of Rabbu. Other financing options for representational building were the treasure of the temple or money from the community. Whichever options there were, the communities in the cities and villages had to pay for the high expenses. The main part was paid for by the local elite that as landowners, merchants, wood traders and priests were able to contribute money to such undertakings.</p>
            <h2
                    class="con10t-toc-entry">5. The meaning of the sanctuaries in Kanatha and in the society of the eastern Mediterranean</h2>
            <p>The dominating position of sanctuaries in the society of the eastern Mediterranean is manifested in several areas. As centers of public life, they fulfilled religious, social, mercantile, therapeutic and personal roles of the general population. Furthermore, they had privileges such as tax exemption and the right to grant asylum. It seems as if many sanctuaries were allowed to decided about water management and thus held an energy potential that made them part of the most important buildings in the settlements. The power of local priests that held several key positions in the community is demonstrated by the ritual act of land seizure in Seeia and its sanctuary by the clergy of Kanatha. This action shows that the local elites, even when subordinate to a larger political system such as in Ptolemaic times or later the Roman Empire, could freely realize their own ideas if that did not interfere with the larger political actors. 
                <br>Many sanctuaries owned estates whose agricultural products covered their own needs or could be sold on markets or exchanged for other goods. The sanctuary of Zeus Uranios in Baitokaike in the Syrian coastal mountain range gives insight about it having privileges such as the right to grant asylum or to sell own products with tax exemption. Due to this, these sanctuaries should be considered centers of dominions. </p>
            <h3
                    class="con10t-toc-entry">5.1. Furnishings of the sanctuaries</h3>
            <p>
                The meaning of sacral centers had to be expressed in a worthy architectural framework, which was achieved by massive temenos walls with towers that marked the sanctuaries as the most powerful places in the settlements. These walls were not only a monumental sign for the meaning of the sanctuaries but also built for the purpose of religious and economic activities. In the districts and the temples, cultic institutions, such as the sacrificial altar, the adyton, the staircase, the crypt and the cultic dinner were housed showing specific cultic practices. If these installations necessary for the practice of the cult become evident stereotypically, it is still present in another architectural makeup. 
                <br>Rich architectural ornaments added to the splendid optics. This was not bound to cultic circumstances, which was not the case for different layouts or forms of constructions, making it open to variation. Decorating elements and their composition derive from Hellenistic and Roman types that were altered in the Hellenistic and early Roman Imperial times. Only in the ongoing 1st century a uniform repertoire of types was established, giving more importance to the Corinthian order. The outer decoration concentrated on the façade of the temple as an eye catcher. The basalt from the Hauran that was used as building material was not visible on the buildings as the walls were plastered and covered by colorful stucco. In middle Imperial times, buildings got decorated with marble. 
                <br>Compared to the buildings in Kanatha, the sanctuaries in villages were of a smaller scale but came close to the work necessary and the luxurious furnishings of buildings with an urban flair. This way, the monumental buildings in Kanatha, especially sanctuaries, became leading forms in the region that were models for temples in the surrounding villages, which can be seen in Souweida, Selaima, Atheila and Mushennef. Very individual creations that are an example for the many regional variations in the diverse range of Hellenistic culture in the eastern Mediterranean were the result of this process.</p>
            <h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">6. The Cults</h2>

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">6.1. Indigenous cults</h3>

            <p>
                Some gods are known from inscriptions in Kanatha and Seeia that are mostly of cosmic character and were worshipped as cosmocrators. Examples are the gods Zeus Megistos and Rabbu from Kanatha as well as Baalschamin from Seeia. Greek titles of gods such as κύριος, δεσπότης, βασιλεὺς, μέγας and μέγιστος and the Latin epitheta Dominus and Maximus are recorded. 
                <br>These epitheta do not speak about the gods as gods of weather, rain or wine but rather mention their general qualities and especially their rank. It is very likely that clans and tribes in the eastern Mediterranean had their own gods with the highest-ranking god being the master of the cosmos. This has increased so much in importance that all other gods became less relevant. From the perspective of religious history, this was a trend towards monotheism. 
                <br>Just like the epitheta, sacral images also worshipped the rank and being of the gods. Attributes such as lightning bolts, the corona or the eagles do not help identify their names but their ranking and personality. Although inscriptions mention the names of Greek gods and imagery is in a Greco-Roman iconography, the gods are still local ones that have been made Greek in their name and appearance. The same thing applies to local places of worship that seem Hellenized in their appearance but differ greatly in the cultic institutions they house.</p>
            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">6.2. The imperial cult</h3>

            <p>Many of the local places of worship in the cities and villages of the eastern Mediterranean were monumentalized or even built anew in the last century BC. In the 2nd century a proper building program can be attested that is focused on religious buildings. These are oriented on older temples in their shape and location. The old temples were reserved for the local deities whereas the new religious buildings also housed the Imperial cult. The architectural furnishing of these sanctuary ensembles stages the connection between the old local cult and the Imperial cult. These complexes at the same time bear witness to the arrangement of the indigenous people with the Roman authority in the area of religious life. This concept allowed the indigenous population to worship not only their own gods but also to participate in the Imperial cult. The religious environment was not part of a syncretistic movement. According to inscriptions, these younger religious buildings in the villages and communities were initiated and funded by local elites. This was a voluntary action instead of one superimposed from Rome. Practice of the Imperial cult was beneficial to the people as the highest-ranking elites earned Roman citizenship and thus could show their belonging to the Roman world. With this religious construct, one could worship two different cults without conflict. One the one hand it was the ancient local deities of the clans that were worshipped up until the Late Antiquity and on the other hand was the emperor as a central political figure in the Roman Empire who receive godly honors after the divinization.</p>
