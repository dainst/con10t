            <h2>Connecting ARchaeology and ARchitecture in Europeana</h2>
            <p>The DAI participates via the online database <a href=

                partner in the multinational European project <a href=

                                                                 target="_blank">CARARE</a>. Subject of the project
                is to aggregate the digital content of the archaeological and architectural
                heritage that the partners hold and make it accessible through <a href=

            <p>The DAI will provide the metadata and thumbnails of 120.000 historic
                photographs. Their glass plate negatives have been digitised for the larger
                part by the project <a href=

                necessary
                completed. The native metadata will be prepared for harvesting by mapping
                in CIDOC-CRM according to the specified metadata schema. Further on the
                data repository is to be configured for harvesting by CARARE using
                OAI-PMH.</p>

            <h2>Cooperation</h2>
            <p>The consortium of the CARARE project consists of 29 partners from 20
                countries including heritage agencies, ministries, archaeology museums,
                research institutes, digital archives and technology providers. The project
                is co-ordinated by Kulturarvsstyrelsen, the Heritage Agency of Denmark,
                with MDR-Partners, a leading specialist partnership working together with
                cultural organisations in Great Britain.</p><img src=

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>CARARE will work with Europe’s network of heritage agencies and
                organisations, archaeological museums and research institutions and
                specialist digital archives to establish an aggregation service that will
                bring 2 million items for Europe’s unique archaeological monuments,
                historic buildings and heritage places into Europeana and will establish
                the methodology for adding 3D and Virtual Reality content to Europeana.
                CARARE will play an important role in ensuring that digital content for
                Europe’s unique archaeological monuments, architecturally important
                buildings, historic town centres and industrial monuments of World,
                European and National heritage importance is interoperable with Europeana
                and accessible alongside contents from national libraries, archives,
                museums and other content providers. CARARE aims to bring new services for
                users.</p>
