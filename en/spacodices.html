            <p>The digital catalog of illuminated manuscripts of medieval Spain is based
                on an inventory of about 4,500 colored small image slides, located in the
                <a
                        href="http://www.dainst.org/en/standort/-/organization-display/ZI9STUj61zKB/14469?">Madrid
                    Department of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI)</a>. The
                collection was compiled between 1962 to 1965 on the initiative of the director
                and art historian Helmut Schlunk, who had a great interest in the early
                medieval art of Spain. Otto Karl Werckmeister at that time employed as
                a research assistant at the DAI Madrid was responsible for the collection's
                composition. Werckmeister and Detlef Noack, photographer of the Institute
                Madrid, visited libraries and archives in Spain, England, France and the
                United States. From this collaboration a number of Werckmeister's publications
                were emerged, and until this day the Spanish illuminated manuscripts remain
                one of his fields of research ( <i>Die Bilder der drei
                    Propheten in der Biblia Hispalense</i> , in: Madrid Releases 4 [1963],
                141-188; <i>The image of the "jugglers" in the Beatus of Silos</i> , in:
                Reading medieval images, 2002, 128-139).</p>
            <p>On site, a special focus was laid on the visual presentation of the manuscripts
                (miniatures, initials), which is why the collection offers a variety of
                close-ups. Thus, the project did not aim to replicate the medieval codex
                in its multi-media diversity. Nevertheless, every single page was completely
                preserved photographically. Furthermore, hybrid forms such as visual mazes
                of letters or diagrams were regarded, which has become a focal point of
                interest in art history. Altogether reproductions of 36 illuminated manuscripts
                of different text categories have been collected. One focal point was the
                Apocalypse comments of Beatus of Liéebana represented in 11 codices.</p>
            <p>Until this day the collection is presumed to be unique. Firstly, because
                some of the considered manuscripts are still accessible only through the
                original or in parts through facsimiles. Secondly, the collection offers
                the chance to reveal coherently the Spanish illuminations of the early
                and high Middle Ages in their artistic diversity and in their various text
                and book types. In addition, this collection is also interesting in the
                perspective of the history of the discipline, since it provides a basis
                for discussions about the early approach to the medieval illuminations
                in general and the Spanish illumination in particular.</p>
            <p>The image slides of illuminated manuscripts are available via the Arachne-Bookbrowser's
                TEI-Viewer. As a viewing tool the TEI-Viewer reproduces the location of
                the miniatures and initials in the book body and their relation to the
                texts. The image material was also supplemented by a series of general
                information complementing the manuscript. The TEI-Viewer thus enables an
                overview of the physical appearance and the visual presentation of the
                respective Codex. Creating connections between the manuscripts TEI-Viewer
                invites to interdisciplinary questions.</p>
