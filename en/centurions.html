            <p>
                This catalogue provides additional information on the funerary monuments discussed in the article “Dressed to Drill. The Evidence of Funerary Monuments on Roman Centurions’ Equipment”, published in the Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies 18. It was intended to compile as many tombstones erected for centurions depicting some part of the deceased’s military equipment as possible. To prevent circular arguments, this paper only draws on tombstones that feature both an inscription indicating that the deceased was a centurion of the Roman army and a depiction of the soldier or at least some part of his military equipment. References to monuments that have been overlooked would be greatly appreciated. They will be included in the "supplements" to this catalogue (nos. 58–XY).
            </p>

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                The numbers of the catalogue entries correspond to those in the table published in the JRMES and used throughout the article. The funerary monuments of men who did not hold the rank of centurion at death are marked with an asterisk (those promoted to other military or public functions) resp. ‘[v]’ (veterans). Some memorials were erected to commemorate also other members of the centurions’ families, what affected the representations to various degrees; a ‘+’ following their names identifies these monuments. The data sets are of varying detail, reflecting the extent and quality of the textual and pictorial information available to me. Some memorials are lost, and inscription and representation survive only in documentation (in varying detail). These are indicated with a ‘°’.
            </p>    
                There are different ways to explore the catalogue:
                <ul compact>
                <li>If you start from the project's landing page (this page), you may use the search box to look for certain words in all the data sets (not the catalogue entries, cf. below). For a spatial search use the map showing the sites where the catalogue entries were found/are kept. In addition, you can explore the catalogue arranged according to different criteria (presumed date of manufacture, rank[s] of the deceased within the centurionate, type[s] of unit, and type[s] of representation). Clicking on a folder symbol displays/hides its subfolders resp. the respective catalogue entries. The magnifying glass next to the folder leads to all the corresponding data sets.
                <li>The catalogue's title (grey field) on the project's landing page is a link to the <a href="https://arachne.dainst.org/catalog/69">full view version of this catalogue</a> (recommended) where the extensive information on the single entries is provided. On the left, you may choose between list (default) or map display of the catalogue. The folders in the list view contain the catalogue entries arranged to different criteria (presumed date of manufacture, rank[s] of the deceased within the centurionate, type[s] of unit, and type[s] of representation). Clicking on a folder symbol displays/hides its subfolders resp. the respective catalogue entries.
                </ul>
                Please note that the data sets are not part of this catalogue (German, in part incomplete, subject to changes by various authors). They are linked to this article's catalogue entries and can be accessed via the blue link followed by the entity ID (catalogue's preview) or the blue links above the catalogue entry (catalogue's full view). Vice versa, the corresponding catalogue entry is provided on the left below the map if you view a data set included in this paper. Where additional information is available in other scientific online databases, these external sources are provided via links in the catalogue entries.
