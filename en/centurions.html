            <p>
                This catalogue provides additional information on the funerary monuments discussed in the article
                "Dressed to Drill. The Evidence of Funerary Monuments on Roman Centurions' Equipment", published in
                the Journal of Roman Military Equipment Studies 18. It was intended to compile as many tombstones
                erected for centurions depicting some part of the deceased’s military equipment as possible. To prevent
                circular arguments, this paper only draws on tombstones that feature both an inscription indicating
                that the deceased was a centurion of the Roman army and a depiction of the soldier or at least some
                part of his military equipment. References to monuments that have been overlooked would be greatly
                appreciated.
            </p>

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">Instructions</h3>
            <p>
                The numbers of the catalogue entries correspond to those in the table published in the JRMES and used
                throughout the article. The funerary monuments of men who did not hold the rank of centurion at death
                are marked with an asterisk (those promoted to other military or public functions) resp. a superscript
                'v' (veterans). Some memorials were erected to commemorate also other members of the centurions'
                families, which affected the representations to various degrees; a '+' following their names identifies
                these monuments. The data sets are of varying detail, reflecting the extent and quality of the textual
                and pictorial information available to me. Some memorials are lost, and inscription and representation
                survive only in documentation (in varying detail). These are indicated with a '°'.
                <br>
                There are different ways to explore the entries of the catalogue: The search box enables you to look
                for certain words in all the data sets. For a spatial search use the map showing the sites where the
                catalogue entries were found. In addition, you can explore the catalogue arranged according to different
                criteria (presumed date of manufacture, rank(s) of the deceased within the centurionate, type(s) of
                unit, and type of representation).
                <br>
                Clicking on a folder symbol displays/hides its subfolders resp. the respective catalogue entries. The
                magnifying glass next to the folder leads to all the corresponding catalogue entries, the number of
                which does not necessarily correspond to the number in parentheses as it indicates only the quantity
                of the next subordinate level`s items. You can access the extensive information on a single entry via
                the blue link followed by the entity ID. Where additional information is available in other scientific
                online databases, these external sources are provided there. To cite an individual entry of this
                catalogue, you may use the respective URL, for example Stockinger 2017, no. 1,
