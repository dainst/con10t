            </p><em>Max
            Freiherr von Oppenheim</em> (1860-1946) was not only a famous explorer
            but also a well known diplomat and collector of oriental artifacts. As
            an employee of the German consulate general in Cairo, he observed the Arabian
            world and excavated Tell Halaf in Syria. In his many expeditions, most
            taking several years, he explored the region between the Levante and Mesopotamia.
            <p>Oppenheim was always accompanied by professional photographers. The Near
                East and its people as well as its nature and architecture kept him mesmerized
                for decades. The result was a collection of <em>13.000 photos</em>
                that captured
                the life and culture of a world gone by.</p>
            <p>Max von Oppenheim's literary contributions and the photo-collection are
                kept in the house-archive of the Bankhaus Sal, Oppenheim jr. &amp; Cie.
                in Cologne. It is owned by the Max Freiherr von Oppenheim Foundation and
                was established in 1929 by von Oppenheim himself.</p>
            <p>Max von Oppenheim's photo-collection is accessible to the greater public
                by the Arachne database. In order to view images of the Max von Oppenheim
