            <p>The agglomeration of data in Arachne over the last three years led to
                the insight that the manual labour of creating metadata for every image
                seemed impractical. Between 2002 and 2007 the number of images stored in
                Arachne expanded from 50,000 to 200,000; our present stock of 820,000
                images represents an increase of around 400%. In cooperation with the
                German Archaeological Institute (DAI) in Rome, the “image_grid project” is
                seeking to solve these problems.</p>
            <p><img src="/con10t/img/imagegrid/image_grid.jpg" align="left"></p>
            <p>With the “image_grid project” we have automatically contextualised about
                400,000 images from the photo library of the DAI Rome. Since its founding
                in 1928, the photo library of the DAI Rome has become one of the world ́s
                most im- portant archives for archaeological imagery and many scientists
                from all over the world visit it, in order to study these images.</p>
            <p>The images were digitized using old microfche-slides and the only
                information was a printed index. We have created a digital image database
                using OCR, in order to take the structure of this index and by using the
                negative numbers of the images. We have also linked images automatically
                with complex metadata, which are derived from digitized inventories,
                scientifc reference works, images, which are now already stored in Arachne
                and other sources. Negative numbers are also used to connect images with
                OCR-texts (as in the iDAI.Bookbrowser or GoogleBooks), and by extracting
                knowledge from these books via text-mining we can connect new metadata to
                these digital images.</p>
