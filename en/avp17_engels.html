            <p>Thanks to its dense archaeological record, the grotto sanctuary on the eastern slope of Pergamon allows a temporally and spatially narrow but particularly detailed view of the religious reality of the late Hellenistic period. The architectural design and the largely preserved inventory allow a reconstruction of banqueting and votive practices and, based on this, an approach to the actors in this sanctuary. Furthermore, the integration of this micro-historical case study into larger cultural-historical contexts allows for a differentiated re-evaluation of the phenomenon summarized in research under the label "natural sanctuaries" and associated with certain paradigms.</p>
            <p>The characteristic architectural feature of the Grotto Sanctuary is an ambivalent combination of existing natural formations and artificial interventions. The two grottoes, which must have provided the numinous impetus for the foundation of the sanctuary at this site, were faced with a building, limiting their public perceptibility and restricting their accessibility. While Grotto 2 served as a water collector and underwent little intervention, Grotto 1 was redesigned to create a specific spatial effect. In addition to the rough treatment of the walls, this also included the natural staging of water brought in via channels and the creation of a cave-like interior space through the architectural integration of the grotto.</p>
            <p style = "margin-bottom: 2vh;">The inventory of the grotto sanctuary is preserved in larger parts in the backfill of Grotto 2, where it was systematically deposited after the destruction of the building in the late 1st century BC. By far the largest part of the finds is pottery, which forms the most extensive closed complex of the 1st century BC known so far from Pergamon. Its detailed presentation fulfills a desideratum of research on Pergamene pottery in particular and on the Hellenistic pottery of Asia Minor in general. Furthermore, it allows a precise dating of the grotto sanctuary to the 1st century BC.</p>

            <p style = "margin-top: 1vh;">Finally, the pottery inventory also allows conclusions to be drawn about the social organization of the sanctuary and the practices carried out there. According to the information provided by the finds, banquet dishes for several dozen visitors as well as ceramics for food storage and preparation were permanently stored in the grotto sanctuary. In this, it differs clearly from other grotto sanctuaries, where it can be assumed that the visitors themselves brought the required tableware. In addition, the striking homogeneity of the banquet ware in particular - in terms of both vessel types and surface treatment - suggests that it was at least partially acquired communally. This practice is attested in inscriptions for cult associations and, especially in such a context, may have served to visually level social differences among banquet participants.</p>
            <p>Direct information about the actors in the sanctuary is provided by the votive offerings, since individual intentions of religious communication can be assumed behind them. In this respect, the terracotta statuettes are the most tangible, but the numerous loom weights as well as some objects coming from the context of pottery production were also addressed as dedicatory offerings here. The terracotta figurines indicate in large majority female dedicators. The reference is made either directly through statuettes depicting elaboratly dressed women or thematically through the broad spectrum of representations that refer explicitly or symbolically to the realm of female sexuality and fertility.</p>

            <p>As with many other examples of so-called natural sanctuaries, the Grotto Sanctuary has no long-standing cultic traditions. Rather, it is a new foundation in a specific historical context. In the near-natural design and possibly also in certain practices, such as the eating on &sigma;&tau;&iota;&beta;ά&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;, references to actual rural sanctuaries are certainly recognizable. The partially artificial grottoes can thus be understood as interpretations of such places in an urban setting. Behind this lies a time-specific interest in idealized rural-idyllic milieus, which is also expressed, for example, in contemporary literature. The grotto sanctuary can thus be understood as an imaginary space in which a broad frame of reference for individual religious needs was created through the appropriation of various numinous properties of natural formations.</p>
            <p>This online catalog contains all cataloged features and find objects from the grotto sanctuary on the eastern slope of the city hill of Pergamon. In addition to the illustrations published in the printed book, the entire photographic documentation is provided here in over 3000 color photographs. On the one hand, this serves to quickly locate the features and objects discussed in the text and to better understand them by means of an enhanced documentation. Secondly, this form of publication should also enable further research on the material culture of Late Hellenistic Pergamon.</p>
