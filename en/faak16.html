			<h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>This online catalog accompanies the book Sea Shells in the Mountains and Llamas on the Coast:
					The Economy of the Paracas Culture (800 to 200 BC) in Southern Peru (Mader 2019), published as part
					of the series “Research into the Archaeology of Non-European Cultures” by the German Archaeological
					Institute (DAI). The catalog provides data and images of archaeological finds and contexts which
					have been excavated since 1996 by the Nasca-Palpa Project of the DAI’s Commission for Archaeology of
					Non-European Cultures (KAAK).</p>

				<p>Due to large-scale excavations, Jauranga (285 m.a.s.l.), Collanco (1.630 m.a.s.l), and Cutamalla
					(3.300 m.a.s.l.) are the most important archaeological sites for this study. The information
					presented in the database served as the primary basis for the research and results which are
					treated at greater length in the monograph. Moreover, the long-term storage of this data makes the
					material available for future investigations. Objects attributed to the Paracas culture (800 to 200 BC) in southern Peru are displayed in museums
					all over the world, attracting visitors and encouraging people to travel to Peru. “Typical” Paracas
					objects are incised polychrome ceramics of high quality, large and extremely carefully made textiles
					with elaborate geometric designs, extravagant mummy bundles with rich grave goods which have been
					preserved in the sandy hyper-arid desert of the Pacific coast, and artificially deformed human
					skulls. The emphasis on this kind of material culture was the foundation for defining the
					archaeological culture, stimulating ideas about the nature of the Paracas society.
					<br>
					The approach chosen in this work complements previous research designs and provides a new perspective
					on the Paracas culture. The archaeological material analyzed here was unearthed in large quantities
					and represents the sphere of everyday life of the Paracas people. An archaeoeconomic methodology was
					applied to look at this material, an approach not previously employed, which explored production,
					exchange, and consumption processes and their interconnections through the archaeological record.</p>

			<h2 class="con10t-toc-entry" style = "clear: both;">Instructions and Archaeological Finds</h2>
			
				<p>The data of this catalog is arranged according to the archaeological material types relevant to this
					study, which are animal bones, botanical material, ground stone, knapped stone, lithics in general,
					malacological material, metal, minerals, and organic material. Sorting the database by these
					material types, you will find detailed information on the objects themselves as well as their
					archaeological sites and contexts.

					Images are available for many, albeit not all, objects. There is also geospatial data available for
					archaeological sites. The basic language of the catalog is Spanish. Because of the general structure
					of the central iDAI.objects Arachne database, some information is provided in German or English.

					From the archaeological material groups, in particular obsidian artifacts, malacological material,
					and camelid bones were comprehensively analyzed, with results explained in detail in the monograph.
					We used a combination of methods for these analyses, including archaeometric techniques,
					quantification, artifact classification, and species determination. Data on the other material types
					was consulted as contextual information in the book, although an in-depth examination similar to the
					one carried out for the three main material groups has not been done yet, and could be performed in
					a next stage of research.</p>

			<h2 class="con10t-toc-entry">Reconstructing the Economic System of the Paracas Culture</h2>
			
				<p>The analysis of the archaeological materials in this catalog was fundamental for the reconstruction
					of the Paracas economic organization, characterized by unbalanced commodity flows in the western
					Andes. Highland resources such as obsidian, camelids and their products were transported towards the
					Pacific desert strip in large amounts, while marine resources such as sea shells reached the
					highlands only in small amounts.

				Raw materials were not just procured in the mountains; there were also strategic centers like Cutamalla,
					where the production and distribution of goods was coordinated. All in all, consumption at coastal
					settlements like Jauranga can be seen as the driving force behind the economy of the Paracas culture.
					Based on these socioeconomic patterns, a new model called economic directness was formulated,
				which is a central outcome of both the catalog and the book.</p>
