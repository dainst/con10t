                The term „wissenschaftliche Materialsammlung“ (engl.: collection of research material), WMS for short,
                is used for all collection of scientific information compiled by Dr. Hinkel for publication in his
                publication series “The Archaeological Map of the Sudan“. Of the about 440 folders and compilations held
                at the archive 288 items were digitized. The remaining folders mostly contain photographs and copies of
                documents, whose originals were digitized as part of of other sub-stocks, as well as personal
                correspondence, which is excempt from digitization at this point in time. The material was integrated
                into the iDAI.bookbrowser and bookmarked according to Hinkel's own arrangement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The digitized collections of research material occasionally contain annotated copies of documents
                produced by a third party (articles, drawings, photographs etc.). The copyright for the annotations by
                Friedrich W. Hinkel rests with the DAI, yet all concerned parties have to be consulted before
                publication.

                The sub-stock “wissenschaftliche Materialsammlung“ is divided into two different types of material:
                documents of the Sudan Antiquities Service copied by Dr. Hinkel (refered to as FRSA) and materials
                collected by Hinkel for his AMS-series. Both categories were structured by Dr. Hinkel according to the
                AMS-system.
