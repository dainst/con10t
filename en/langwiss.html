            <p>The contact between Greek and Roman culture was often in the focus of historic and archaeological research as Rome’s reach into the eastern Mediterranean in the 2nd c. BC lead to a continuous exchange between Greece and Rome. This work is treating a part of the complex relationship: the reception of Greek education and its visual presence in Roman everyday life.</p>
            <p>In addition to previous works that mainly treated large marble images, the focus here will be put on images of a smaller format that are investigated on their qualities as cultural forms of expression of the educational discourse and its visual transformation. This work is a combination of systematic painter oriented analysis of the quantitatively most important medium of ring stones and a function oriented analysis of small-scale images in general. Three levels have to be distinguished in relation to the aims and questions of the project. The first, the painted oriented level, is an iconographic and typological investigation of the ring stones. Afterwards, the respective appearances are going to be under investigation, in which the depictions were integrated into Roman life and received in everyday situations. The third step is to ask questions on the material that exceeds traditional borders of the respective medium.</p>
            <p>Aside from individual and role portraits of Greek thinkers and poets, the visualization of trains of thoughts in a typecast manner can be proven. The diverse realizations each reflect their principal views on mental work in their own way. The classes, in which the mentioned depictions are receive in varying sizes, are manifold but most of the time it is known in glyptics or sculpture, far less often in silver and table ware, lamps or in the form of applications on furniture. Even taking coincidence of passing the object on into account that would have had an effect on the respective class, no dominance of a particular philosopher, speaker, or scheme of depiction was equally proven. The heterogeneous character of the material remains affects the classes of art as well as single persons and types of depictions.</p>
            <p>The online catalog will for the first time systematically compile the receptional media on the discourse of Greek education apart from the already well-documented life-sized sculpture and at the same time photographically and scientifically index the material class of gems and cameos. The detailed documentational part will not only openly display the groundwork of the interpretative-hermeneutic results in the online catalog but also made accessible for research on overarching cultural historic questions.</p>
            <p>The catalog – just like the shortened print version – is organized into the material classes of glyptics/seal prints, reliegs, sculpture and varia (bronzes, toreutics, lamps). A secondary coding will structure portraits and typical depictions, beginning with known images as well as typologically related pieces. The typecast images will follow. Within this organization, the pieces are alphanumerically sorted by their location. All pieces that could be investigated in the original form are marked with “vidi”.</p>
