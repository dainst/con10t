            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">The <i>Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica</i></h3>

            <p>
                The <i>Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica</i> – Institute of Archaeological Correspondence - was formally founded as a private association in Rome on April 21st 1829. The foundation was based on a network of correspondents which soon expanded throughout Europe. In addition to the scholars of antiquity and archaeologists living in Rome, the associated and corresponding members included collectors and patrons, artists and architects, excavators and art dealers as well as laymen interested in archaeology. The foundation was inspired by a European mindset and was intended to be supported jointly by Germans, French, English, Italians and others in terms of its contents, organisation and finances.
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <con10t-image src="/con10t/img/gelehrtenbriefe/Monumenti2_Titelblatt_CasaTarpea.jpg"
                        align="left" width="480"
                        alt="Monumenti2_Titelblatt_CasaTarpea">
                        Casa Tarpea, Institute on the capitol hill in Rome 1836-1877,<br> idealized view (detail of the cover page of Monumenti Inediti 1834-1838)
                </con10t-image>
            <p>But this idealistic thought by itself was not quite sufficient. The Institute was soon troubled by financial worries. Prussia, which from the beginning had provided premises at the Legation in Rome, gradually increased its funding until the Prussian Ministry of Culture funded the Instituto’s entire budget from 1859 onwards. This constituted a significant turning point in the history of the Institute, which was later transformed into a Prussian State Institute in 1871 and then into the Imperial German Archaeological Institute in 1874. The Institute, once founded as a joint European venture, thus evolved into the first German Cultural Institute in Rome.</p> 
            

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">History and structuring of the letter archives</h3>
            
            <p>From its foundation in 1829 onwards, an archive was established in Rome with August Kestner, Hanoverian envoy to the Holy See, as its first archivist. The correspondence which gave the Institute its name – incoming letters from corresponding members and the exchanging letters between the Institute's secretaries and associates – were systematically archived from the start. Today, the approximately 26.000 letters are sorted alphabetically by sender and form the section of the “Scholarly letters” in the <a href="https://www.dainst.org/standort/-/organization-display/ZI9STUj61zKB/18485" target= "_blank">archive of the Rome Department of the DAI.</a><p>

                            align="right" width="250"

                            </con10t-image>

             <p>In 1929, on the occasion of the Institute’s 100th anniversary celebration, the "Archive on the History of Archaeology" was founded by former President Gerhart Rodenwaldt at the Berlin Head Office. The bequests of letters of Eduard Gerhard and Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker, amongst others, were both the basis and the heart of the archive. Nowadays, the archive at <a href="https://www.dainst.org/standort/zentrale/archiv" target= "_blank">the Berlin Head Office</a> holds more than 30,000 autographs, including the correspondence between more than 3,000 international classical scholars, their colleagues and friends (among them Alexander von Humboldt, Adele Schopenhauer and Friedrich Wilhelm IV). The letters are part of individual bequests, most of which contain documents sent by various correspondents to the holder.
            
            <p>The unique collections of letters in the archives of the Head Office and the Rome Department bear witness to scientific plans and projects of the Institute. The correspondents reported in constant written exchange on their archaeological discoveries, finds and collections and discussed their research and publications as well as historical and personal events. In addition to being eminently important sources of knowledge on archaeology, the history of archaeology and ancient sciences in the 19th and early 20th century, the letters also highlight the dense network that had formed around the  <i>Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica</i>.

                As a part of a <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/318512975" target= "_blank">DFG-project</a> the autographs will be catalogued and digitised at the level of individual letters and made available online to researchers in open access.
            <p>
                In the first project phase, all correspondence from the founding of the Institute in 1829 to around 1860 is being processed. This date was chosen because the gradual "nationalisation" of the Institute assumed concrete forms from 1859 onwards; this development occurred parallel to the formation of national states both in Italy and in Germany. Bequests of letters from important archaeologists - such as the segretario fondatore Eduard Gerhard - holding at the Head Office in Berlin were selected to complement the Roman correspondences which likewise started before 1859.
            <p>
                The letters are catalogued in <a href="http://kalliope-verbund.info" target= "_blank">Kalliope</a>, the national system of proof for bequests and autographs. The data sets contain a link to the digitized letters on iDAI.objects, the DAI’s main data publication system. All metadata are integrated into <a href="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001474332" target= "_blank">iDAI.bibliography</a> (<a href=https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001474332 >DAI Rome</a>, <a href=https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001548031 target= "_blank">DAI Head Office Berlin<a/>).
            <p>
                The collected data are being evaluated and visualized concerning their relationships to each other by using various IT models. Using text mining methods and Named Entity Recognition, a selection of letters, which are available in typewritten transcriptions, is semi-automatically provided with annotations on people and places mentioned. In the wake of this process, individuals, places and objects are being identified and, if necessary, entered into corresponding norm databases. The developed visualization tools are currently in the test phase and will soon be available online.

               The gathered data will be analyzed and their relationship will be visualized through information technological models. Text Mining and Named Entity Recognition will semi-automatically add annotations about mentioned people and places from the written texts. As a part of the project, persons, places and objects can be identified and possibly be added into a norm database. The developed tools for visualization are currently in a test phase and will soon be accessible online.
