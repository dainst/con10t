            <p>
                The <i>Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica</i> – Institute of Archaeological Correspondences was formally founded as a private club on April 21st 1829. The basis of the institute was going to be a network of correspondents, which quickly spanned Europe. Aside from the classicists and archaeologists that lived in Rome, mostly collectors and patrons, artists and architectures, excavators and art dealers belonged to the circle of associated and corresponding members. The establishment was influenced by European thinking and was going to be funded by German, French, English, Italian and other sponsors.

                </con10t-image>
            <p>The idealistic thought alone did not suffice though. The institute was soon having financial issues. Prussia, which from the beginning on provided rooms in the embassy in Rome, continuously took over the funding until the Prussian Cultural Ministry had to cover all funds in 1859. This marks a turning point in the  <a href="https://www.dainst.org/dai/geschichte/von-rom-nach-berlin">history of the institute</a>, which was first relabeled as a Prussian Ministry in 1871, then as the Imperial German Archaeological Institute in 1874. The once European institution thus became the first German culture institute in Rome.</p> 
            

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">History and structuring of the letter archives</h3>
            
            <p>An archive, whose first archivist was August Kestner, Hannoveran Ambassador at the Holy See, was already established with the foundation of the institute in 1829. The eponymous correspondences, the incoming letters of corresponding members and the exchange between secretaries and employees of the institute, was systematically archived since its foundation. Today, the 26,000 alphabetically structured letters (by sender) form the group “Scholarly letters” in the <a href="https://www.dainst.org/standort/rom/archiv">archive of the Rome Department of the DAI.</a><p>

                            <con10t-image src="/con10t/img/gelehrtenbriefe/Eduard Gerhard (Dirigierender Sekretar 1829-1832).jpg"
                            align="right" width="250"
                            alt="Eduard Gerhard (Dirigierender Sekretar 1829-1832)">

                            </con10t-image>

                On the occasion of the centennial celebration of the institute in 1929 the “archive of the history of archaeology” was founded in the head office in Berlin by then-president Gerhardt Rodenwaldt. The core of the archive was the letter bequest of Eduard Gerhard and Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker. The <a href="https://www.dainst.org/standort/zentrale/archiv" >archive of the head office in Berlin</a> holds more than 30,000 autographs, among these correspondences between more than 3,000 international classicists as well as their colleagues and friends (f.e. Alexander von Humbodt, Adele Schopenhauer and Friedrich Wilhelm IV). The letters are parts of single bequests, most addressed to the eponymous correspondent.
            <p>The unique letter collections in the archives of the head office and the Rome Department bear witness to scientific planning and enterprises of the institute. In a steady fashion, the correspondents report from their archaeological discoveries, finds and collection and also discuss their research and publication as well as historic and personal events. The letters are also a very significant source of knowledge about archaeology, the history of archaeology and classical studies in the 19th and early 20th century, on the other side they bear witness of a dense network that formed around the  <i>Instituto di Corrispondenza Archeologica</i>.

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">DFG-project on the indexing and accessibility of the “Scholarly Letters” collection</h3>
            
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            </con10t-image>
            <p>
                As a part of a <a href="http://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/318512975" >DFG-project</a> the autographs are researched on a single letter level, digitized and made accessible to research as open access online.
            <p>
                The current phase of the project is working on the correspondence from the foundation of the institute to around 1860. This date was chosen because around 1859 a nationalization of the institute started to take place; parallelly in German and Italy. From the archive holdings of the “Scholarly Letters” in Rome correspondences were selected that started in 1859. Letter bequests of important archaeologists, such as the segretario fondatore Eduard Gerhard, were gathered from the archive of the head office in order to complete Roman letters.
            <p>
                The primary indexing is done in  <a href="http://kalliope-verbund.info" >Kalliope</a>, the national system of proof for bequests and autographs. The datasets contain a link to the digitized letters in iDAI.objects. All metadata will be integreated into <a href="https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001474332" >iDAI.bibliography</a> (<a href=https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001474332 >DAI Rome</a>, <a href=https://zenon.dainst.org/Record/001548031 >DAI Head Office Berlin<a/>).

            <p>&nbsp;</p> 
               The gathered data will be analyzed and their relationship will be visualized through information technological models. Text Mining and Named Entity Recognition will semi-automatically add annotations about mentioned people and places from the written texts. As a part of the project, persons, places and objects can be identified and possibly be added into a norm database. The developed tools for visualization are currently in a test phase and will soon be accessible online.
