            Studies on the history of archaeology as well as on the history of academic institutions, such as the DAI, have demonstrated the importance of archival research and investigation of primary source material. The project “AthenDigital: Das Nachlassarchiv”, which was funded by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Sondermittel Kulturerhalt) between 2016 and 2017, aimed to record and digitize the three largest scholars’ bequests currently stored in the archive of the DAI, Athens department, namely those of Wilhelm Dörpfeld, Habbo Gerhard Lolling and Adolf Hermann Struck. The archived materials in these three bequests provide a vivid testimony to the beginnings of the DAI Athens and include rich information on the early undertakings of German scholars and archaeologists in Greece. They also include unpublished material which is of special interest for archaeological research in general but also for the history of research on several Greek archaeological sites and monuments.

            <h3 class="con10t-toc-entry">Wilhelm Dörpfeld (1853 – 1940)</h3>
                <p>
                    Dörpfeld was Director (“Erster Sekretär”) of the DAI Athens from 1887 to 1912. His bequest includes approx. 25 diaries and three files with personal notes on his own excavations, including those at the Enneakrounos, the Athenian Acropolis and the Pnyx, as well as on Corfu and the island of Leukas in cooperation with the Archaeological Society at Athens. His notes and diaries are considered to this day as exemplary for the study of ancient architecture and modern techniques of archaeological excavation and recording.

                Lolling studied Classics at Göttingen and first came to Athens as a private tutor. From 1878 to 1888 he was employed interchangeably as Deputy Director and Librarian and his presence had an important impact on the early years of the DAI Athens. His passion for topography and epigraphic studies took him on numerous journeys across Greece and west Turkey. A vivid testimony of these journeys is to be found in his bequest, including over 50 notebooks and sketchbooks containing fundamental observations on ancient Greek topography, a priceless scholarly resource for ancient sites that do not exist like that anymore.

                Struck was a self-trained archaeologist but he was mainly employed as a planner for the Oriental Railway, mostly in northern Greece. Between 1905 and 1911 he worked for the DAI Athens, also becoming active in the Kerameikos project, where he was responsible for excavation recording. From a thematic point of view, the main part of his bequest covers his journeys across northern Greece, as well as his studies on Byzantine architecture.                <p>
