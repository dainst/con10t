                Bitterer, The Basilica Aemilia on the Forum Romanum in Rome. Focus of public
                life.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>According to Livius (40, 51, 4-5), the original building was inaugurated
                by the censors M. Aemilius Lepidus and M. Fulvius Nobilior 179 B.C. The
                basilica was a single-story construction with a nave and two aisles on
                either side. The construction material was tuff, a local type of volcanic
                rock, and also travertine, limestone, which originated from Tivoli. Several
                fire disasters made it necessary to restore and renew the building. In
                the early years of the 1st century B.C., the basilica was converted into
                a two-story building. It was completely renovated under the reign of Augustus
                after a fire in 14 A.D. without fundamentally changing the form of the
                previous buildings, but by using a different material: marble from Luni.
                The floor of the nave was decorated with precious polychrome marble while
                the floor of the side aisles was covered with white marble. The marble
                cladding of the inside walls were also decorated with reliefs of pentelic
                marble, representing significant scenes of the founding history of Rome.
                The portico facing the forum had a lavish façade with doric columns crowned
                by a high attic. The outer side of the attic showed sumptuous sculptural
                decorations. In the center of the parapet plates were the imagines clipeatae,
                showing probably Parthian officials. Those were flanked by monumental barbarian
                statues sculpted from coloured marble. Even though it is not possible to
                clearly reconstruct the statuary type of the barbarians, it is likely that
                those statues also showed Parthian officials, symbolising a nation subjected
                by the Romans. They refer to Augustus’ not only military but also diplomatic
                victory concluding a peace treaty with the Parthians in 20 B.C. Above the
                portico and the shops there was a monumental terrace, which, in the rear
                part, was surmounted by a loggia, decorated by the well-known pillars with
                tendril motives. In all probability, this terrace is to be identified with
                the maeniana mentioned by ancient authors. From the maeniana it was possible
                to watch the activities on the Forum Romanum but it was also used as a
                spectators' stand for celebrations and processions.</p>
            <p>The archaeological record allows to draw conclusions about the various
                functions of the basilica. The inside showed a luxurious area with interior
                designed for mercantile and monetary use. It was used as a bank as well
                as a shop for luxury goods made of precious metal. The shops, which served
                most likely as sales locations, but also might have been used as bankers'
                offices, showed sumptuous decorations. As was common in most basilicas
                at the time, it is highly probable that lawsuits were also held at the
                Basilica Aemilia, especially financial tribunals which would go well with
                the monetary function of the building.</p>
            <p>As the Basilica Aemilia was a very well visited building, it was perfectly
                suited for political representation. In the time of the Roman Republic,
                it was the gens Aemilia whose family patriarchs represented themselfs in
                sculpture. Later, during the Roman Empire, the emperor occupied this privilege.
                These various functions were already embedded in the original Basilica
                Aemilia building of 179 B.C. The new Augustan building had to include them
                as well, which is why the traditional model was kept. The most significant
                formal difference between the new building and its predecessors is the
                marble facing. At the same time the iconographic program of the building
                was slowly changing in order to politically represent the imperial family.
                Characteristics of the Augustan iconography are mythological themes praising
                the Roman history, from the founding heroes all the way up to the present
                golden age. The Basilica Aemilia with its functions and its interior is
                not merely a public building but more a part of a huge political context
                in the city centre, along with the other buildings around the forum.</p>
            <p>During the investigations in the area between the Via Sacra and the porticos
                of the Basilica Aemilia a series of small sanctuaries (sacella) has been
                discovered, of which only the one of Venus Cloacina is known by name. Due
                to their simple design and small dimensions, these sacella had a somewhat
                rural character. They all faced the forum with their major sides, whereas
                the actual cult areas, located on a lower level, were accessible by steps
                from one of the minor sides. Those sacella are most likely to be identified
                with the archeia mentioned by Cassius Dio (1 Frg. 6 [2]). According to
                mythological tradition, Numa Pompilius performed official acts in this
                place. As the archeia are closely linked with the founding history of Rome,
                they have always been particularly important. This is mainly evidenced
                in the fact, that the sanctuaries have repeatedly been renewed down to
                late antiquity.</p>
