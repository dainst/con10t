            <p>The project “Terracotta Masks” is based on a dissertation about Roman
                Terracotta masks in the northwestern provinces conducted at the University
                of Cologne.</p>
            <p>The project includes the provinces Britannia, Germania inferior and
                superior as well as Gallia Belgica and extended to discovery sites in
                Raetia that are situated in the Federal Republic of Germany. So far, seven
                mask production sites have been detected: Nimwegen, Cologne,
                Frankfurt-Heddernheim, Trier, Rheinzabern, Neusäß-Westheim near Augsburg
                and Straubing. Cologne and Trier present supra-regionally important
                production centers whereas the other potteries seem to have served the
                local or regional market only. The life-size masks emerge within the region
                in the 1st century AD and experienced their period of prosperity in the 2nd
                century AD. For the 3rd century, production is traceable solely in Trier.
                The greatest part portrays baldheaded, beardless, male faces with
                caricatured features that also bear characteristics of farce-masks. Only
                few fragments refer to characters of the New Comedy or Tragedy. There are
                barely any Dionysian masks at all. The transformation of the established
                Roman masks into individual types manifests itself in their special shape –
                one very striking peculiarity are the big bared teeth – as well as in the
                relation of the mask genres among each other. The life-size terracotta
                masks were part of the domicile equipment. Like the oscilla they were set
                up in the props of buildings. Their function as a decorative element
                derives from find contexts but is also supported by technical details as
                well as their proportions. Since many were found in complex houses with
                strong Roman touches in architecture as well as interior, it suggests that
                they expressed the typical Roman habitus. Especially in the provinces,
                demonstrating the cultural sphere was an essential aspect of
                self-expression between the conflicting priorities of indigenous and Roman
                ethnical elements. Numerous finds of masks underline the significance of
                the military as an important carrier of Roman culture in the northwestern
                provinces. The propositions linked to the masks seem controversial. On the
                one hand the usage of this cipher is supposed to indicate the affiliation
                to the Roman culture, but on the other hand, the masks show strong local
                characteristics. Precisely this discrepancy could mirror the Romanizing
                process of the region.</p>
            <p>The project “Terracotta masks” implements the advanced method of
                combining the advantages of both traditional and innovative publication
                media. The catalogue, which contains roughly 500 objects and served as a
                basis for the study, is available as an online edition in the Arachne
                database for free. The evaluation of the material with its conclusions and
                interpretations was released in the 2006 publication entitled “Die
                römischen Terrakottamasken in den Nordwestprovinzen” (“Roman Terracotta
                Masks in the Northwestern Provinces) as XXXVII. volume of the Monumenta
                Artis Romanae series published by the Reichert-Verlag. The online
                presentation provides a coherent depiction of the vast catalogue with many
                detailed images and illustrations. This medium also offers new
                possibilities of detection, categorization and comparison. Relevant
                research criteria are for example discovery site, production site or serial
                affiliation. Terracotta masks are molded wares, therefore the objects are
                systemized by series (as far as possible). Wherever completely preserved
                specimens were missing in the past, the appearance of the series was
                completed then by combining different graphic reconstructions. These serial
                drawings are also available in Arachne. Anchoring the online catalogue in
                Arachne has ensured the permanent cultivation and updating of the data.
                Updates are visually distinguished and may concern individual information
                about an object or even the addition of new objects.</p>
            <p>By publishing the book both in its printed and online version, it is
                possible to combine these different types of media to fully exploit their
                respective advantages: an analysis which, based on solid research,
                represents the current state of research and processes the information
                gained from the material adequately in form of a printed book on the one
                hand, and an extensive, richly illustrated, upgradable online-catalogue
                that offers the previously mentioned advantages for research and is so
                lengthy that it would be sheer impossible to print for cost concerns and
                reasons of space.</p>
            <p>I am deeply grateful for all the assistance rendered by the Research
                Archive for Ancient Sculpture. My special thanks goes to Professor Reinhard
                Förtsch, head of the Research Archive. He supported the idea of combining
                the book and online edition and made the integration of the terracotta
                masks into the Arachne database possible. In doing so he has also ensured
                the permanent cultivation and updating of the data. Photographical advice
                and technical support was given by Philipp Groß, who took the pictures. The
                production drawing was done by Amira Smadi, staff illustrator of the
                Archaeological Institute of Cologne.</p>
