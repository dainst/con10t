                The photographs and slides, dating back to the early 1940s, represent the largest number of all
                digitized items in the Archive of Friedrich W. Hinkel. The archive contains about 45.895 photographs
                and slides (33.744 photographs belonging to 1.652 negative films as well as 12.151 slides), which were
                scanned in the course of the digitization project. Duplicates and reproductions of other (already
                scanned) material were excluded from digitization. Due to the large period of time covered by the
                photographic material its does not only include pictures made in the Sudan but also photographic
                documentation of Dr. Hinkel's travels as an employee of the Deutschen Bauakademie (since 1971 called
                Bauakademie der DDR) as well as private journeys within Germany and all over the world. The digitized
                photographs and slides were structured according to the AMS-system.
                Pictures made outside of the Sudan were also associated with their respective places in the
                iDAI.gazetteer, through which one can access the data based on their location.

                In order to retain the quotation system introduced by Hinkel in his publication series “The
                Archaeological Map of the Sudan“ the photographs were divided into small format pictures (KB) in black
                and white (sw) and in color (co) and 6x6 sized pictures (MF/ film abbreviation R) in black and white (sw)
                and color (co). The slides were numbered according to Dr. Hinkel's own notes including slide numbers
                as well as film and picture numbers. The metadata for all photographs and slides is based on Hinkel's
                note in his photo and slide inventories and represent his own interpretations of the subject matter.

                Unless stated otherwise, all pictures were made by Friedrich W. Hinkel. The copyright rests with the DAI.
