            <p>The Plaster Cast Collection of the Academic Art Museum of the University
                of Bonn is gradually being photographically documented and transferred into
                Arachne since 1998. That way the technical emphases of the Archaeological
                Institutes of Cologne and Bonn can be brought closer together by two
                facilities that are marked by the Roman and Greek art in a very significant
                way: The Plaster Cast Collection of Bonn and the CoDArchLab in Cologne. The
                Plaster Cast Collection of Bonn is one of the greatest in Europe, whereas
                the CoDArchLab possesses the greatest specialized photo-collection in the
                realm of ancient sculpture.</p>
            <p>Within the province of Greek art, archaeological research and teaching
                would gain access to an important resource from the University of Bonn.</p>
            <p>The desired collimation does not only combine the images and the data of
                Greek and Roman sculpture, the media also complement each other and are
                used as basic tools for educational purposes along with photographs.
                Although casts have the advantage of being three-dimensional physical
                copies, it is a lot easier to collect photographs, thus permitting a higher
                density for documentation and creating comparative rows. Often it is easier
                to take pictures of the essential side- and back view of a copy of a
                monument than the original. Plaster casts are able to reflect the round
                plastic form of an antique monument more accurately than photographs, since
                the shading is difficult to calculate. Illuminated and photographed under
                consistent circumstances, they often provide valuable information
                concerning certain research problems. Moreover, comparing them amongst
                themselves may offer more accurate relations than by heterogeneous
                photographs. Therefore it is most desirable to exploit both media in their
                complex form with their different complimentary characteristics for
                teaching.</p>
