                The Roman Empire changed in many aspects between the 3rd and 5th century AD, yet the order of society remained somewhat the same. The well-preserved remains of residential houses in the port city Ostia allow insights into the relationship of continuity and transformation between Imperial times and Late Antiquity.

            <p>
                Changes in the distribution of upper class living quarters is mirrored in urban development: From the 3rd century onwards, a concentration of large and richly decorated residences in the southern part of the city can be identified, which might be due to high levels of vacancy in industrial buildings and residential complexes. Abandoned residential and industrial complexes in the northern parts of the city have not been converted and started to decay. The contrast between the decline of the city in certain parts as well as the maintenance and upgrading in others became ever more clear. Senators from Rome built extravagant fountains, portici, and squares in the upscale neighborhoods of the city, while during the 4th and 5th century many of the decaying facades were hidden behind roadblocks.

                During the time of the investigation, changes in the structures of organization within the buildings and their decorative furnishings can be observed: the residences that were constructed towards the beginning of the time of investigation are still in the tradition of Imperial peristyle houses. The three parts of the minimalistic entrance situations are characteristic, as are a courtyard that is surrounded by corridors and small rooms and a section in the back with a large room. Compared to older peristyle houses, it becomes clear that in the 3rd century a clear and finite distinction between courtyard and corridors was made. In renovations of older houses and in new constructions of the 4th and early 5th century, more changes can be seen: the entrance situations became bigger, courtyards were often only surrounded by corridors on one side and the large rooms often display apses. An increased luxury of the furnishings that was concentrated on the sequence of entrance, courtyard and room also came along with the changes. Apart from some small differences, these transformations can also be observed in all other parts of the Mediterranean between the 3rd and 5th century for luxurious residences.

                These developments allow considering changing forms of the use of rooms. The segmentation of the corridors around the courtyard and the reduction to a single linear corridor in late antique houses shows that there must have been a need for more controlled access in the movement of visitors. Guest access could be limited to the dining room and the way leading there. The visitor could be guided through the luxurious parts of the house in a very calculated manner. The mentioned changes can be traced back to an increased need to distinguish the representational section of the house from the more private ones. Changes in the representative sections show an increasingly ostentative display of luxuries towards the visitors. The house owners actual or hoped for belonging to the elites is no longer expressed through the evoking of bucolic and sacred atmosphere but is now shown through a direct display of their wealth and influence.

                While the largest houses in Ostia could be connected to properties of the Roman senatorial elites by inscriptions on lead pipes or literary sources, the owners of other properties seem to have been owned by local elite, wealthy merchants and priests. Tabernae and living annexes that were often part of these buildings were likely rented out to clients of the owners. In other places, larger city residence and villae can be linked to men of senatorial standing, which in Late Antiquity also includes functionaries from Constantinople, Christian bishops and “barbarian” generals aside from the old Roman aristocrats. Despite their presented heterogeneity, the elite had a rather uniform taste in residences. It seems to have been influenced by public buildings and Imperial residences and in turn influence the living architecture of the broader public.

                The catalog, which is shortened in the printed version but included fully here, documents 18 residences that were researched within my PhD thesis. The interested reader is to be presented a transparent documentation. The catalog contains information that is mentioned in the analytical part of the book. This includes detailed information on the state of preservations, descriptions of the layouts and the remaining structures, depictions in building and research history, references to literature as well as information on the single rooms. The decimals are rounded to two digits. The sizes of the respective sides are recorded clockwise, beginning in the north. The definitions of the walls were done as is usual, with the definitions of T. L Heres [T. L. Heres, Paries. A proposal for a dating system of late-antique masonry structures in Rome and Ostia (Amsterdam 1982)].
