            <p>The DFG project was conducted by the TU Berlin, Institute for Art Sciences and Historical Urbanism (Prof. Dr. Von Buttlar) and the Humboldt University in Berlin, Institute for Prussian History (Prof. Dr. Neugebauer, HU and BBAW) from May 2013 to August 2018. The cataloging of the contributions that the province of Brandenburg (with the city of Berlin) were a thus untouched subject for the heritage management and restorations.</p>

            <p>The interchanging effects between heritage management as done by the monarchy, the initiatives  of the provincial association and the construction ministries of the government are investigated while keeping in mind the general debate on how to deal with conservation and restoration that was held in 1900. In the case of important and significant monuments, Wilhelm I and II contributed more than the “highest of funds” to ongoing procedures in the province of Brandenburg.</p>
            <p>Many aspects of restoration, production facilities and additions to the built and artistic monuments from the province of Brandenburg and Berlin were researched and depicted in whole for the first time. The topographic area of research covers the entire province of Brandenburg (administrative area of Potsdam and Frankfurt/Oder and the towns that became of Greater-Berlin in 1920) and the historic city of Berlin. Furthermore, towns in the historic eastern Brandenburg and in the Neumark (Poland) were considered. The categories most prominent to heritage management such as town and monastery churches, castles and hospital chapels, city halls, city gates and wall, towers and ruins of castles were the main focus of the investigation. With the broadening of the term of heritage management urbanistic uncoverings, remodeling of city squares and changes around historically grown city structures (f.e. the city hall of Frankfurt/O., the surroundings of the Marienkirche in Prenzlau, competitions for the city hall of Potsdam and the opera in Berlin) became another point of interest. The first systematic and photographic recording and indexing of significant heritage monuments from the Middle Ages to the Baroque that was carried out by Albert Schwarz (1836-1906) for the municipal authorities of the city of Berlin was also incorporated into the research. Several methods of “interventions” had to be distinguished as for example repair works, excavations, restorations, completions of paintings, re-creations (of production facilities), stylistic unifications, new creations in a historical style. The material used by the authorities also have to be taken into consideration, such as cement, asphalt, iron and fibre cement. In cooperation with the DAI and the CoDArchLab in Cologne, the object database Arachne will be used to document the restoration works on single monuments by compiling archival sources, mappings, survey plans, historic photographs and articles from construction magazines. A selection of the most signification heritage monuments in the database were further worked on and later published in  <a href ="http://www.reimer-mann-verlag.de/controller.php?cmd=detail&titelnummer=302807&verlag=3" target="_blank">“Preußische Denkmalpflege of Imperial times - The province of Brandenburg and Berlin 1870-1918”, Gebr. Mann Berlin 2019.</a></p>
            <p>The projects investigates and analyzes the doings and position towards heritage management of the first conservator of artistic heritage monuments in Prussia, Ferdinand von Quast compared to the following conservators Rudolf Bergau, Heinrich von Dehn-Rotgels, Reinhold Persius and Hans Lutsch. It was further considered in which extent it would be possible to incorporate a new and more careful handling of the architectonic heritage with the newly created position of provincial conservator that was created at the same time as the Provincial Commission for the Preservation and Investigation of Heritage Monuments (also being responsible for the capital of Berlin), in cooperation with the conservator of the Cultural Ministry for Heritage Monuments in Prussia located in Berlin. The articles “Berichte über die Verhandlung der Provinzial-Kommission für die Denkmalpflege in der Provinz Brandenburg und über die Tätigkeit des Provinzial-Konservators” that were published from 1897 to 1916 are another source of information aside from the reports of the provincial conservators Gustav Bluth, Georg Büttner and Theodor Goecke.</p>
            <p>It is of central importance that the processes of preservation of architectural heritage monuments in the 19th century were conducted in a newly created field between historical architecture and heritage management. One of the difficulties was that the conserving and careful restoring, which was implemented by F. von Quast and H. Von Dehn-Rotfelser, was hard to conduct on a municipal level. During the creation process of the inventories of the built and artistic heritage monuments (1880-1885 and 1899-1907) it became obvious that the general conscience for regional monuments was promoted by initiative of architects, conservators and members of the provincial commission. The statement of the provincial conservators gave answers to the question which factors increase the often present discrepancies between theoretical and practical restoration and which countering undertakings were to be found between the Cultural Ministry and the Provincial Commission and between some provincial conservators and the conservators of the Prussian Cultural Heritage as well as the construction officials of the municipal administrations and their respective areas of responsibility. The progress but sometimes also the stagnation in the development of the official heritage management between 1860/1870 and WWI can be observed on the basis of the province of Brandenburg and Berlin. 
            </p>
            <p>The approach that the state constitutes some tasks but also takes over others that are brought to it by the public is topic of the work “Acta Borussica” N.F. Such interchange is visible when the opinions towards official heritage management were considered during the development of the Prussian heritage management when the demands about content that were raised at the assemblies of the Gesamtverein der Geschichts- und Altertumsvereine. </p>
