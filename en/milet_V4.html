               <p>Excavations at Miletus to locate Archaic occupation material occurred mainly on two hills, Kalabaktepe, a town site first settled ca. 700 B.C. south of the harbors of Miletus, and Zeytintepe, where a sanctuary to Aphrodite was established in the earlier seventh century B.C.</p>

               <p>Two types of Archaic fine wares are presented in this catalog – Laconian (400 entries, numbers beginning with “L”) and Chian (190 entries, numbers beginning with “Ch”) (with one vase imitating Chian, Ch157). Both are preserved in highly fragmentary condition, with the Chian especially prone to surface flaking and wear. Most of this pottery dates to the first half of the sixth century B.C. The finds at Miletus add significantly to knowledge of the important Laconian and Chian vase industries in the Archaic period and to pottery use and distribution patterns across the Aegean Sea.</p>

               <p>The Laconian finds represent the largest corpus from this production center discovered so far on any overseas site, rivalling and occasionally surpassing Laconian pottery found on Samos. Finely painted scenes shed light on Spartan myth, religion, cultural values and daily life. Individual Laconian painters’ hands and workshops are distinguished. Although preservation is poor, the quality of the Laconian pottery is remarkably high. Some of the finest known pieces by the best painters are represented here. Vase shapes reveal aspects of on-site usage particularly in the context of the Miletus Aphrodite Sanctuary. In general, the pottery provides evidence for trade and cultural exchange between Laconia and East Greece. </p>

               <p>The catalog includes over 60 entries for Laconian II cups, more than 150 entries for black-figure or pattern-decorated cups attributed or associated with all the major Laconian painters, along with almost 70 unattributed cup pieces. More than 100 catalogue entries belong to a dozen other shapes, primarily kraters and aryballoi. The Laconian II cups are particularly unexpected and noteworthy.</p>

               <p>Likewise for Chian fine ware, the material at Miletus is second or third in rank among export destinations based on quantity, well short of that found at Naucratis, but about equal to the Chian pottery from Berezan/Olbia in the Black Sea, although not so well preserved. Historically good relations between Chians and Milesians are reflected in the pottery finds, especially given the sparsity of Chian pottery on nearby Samos. Over all, the quality of the decoration is high, including several examples of the Grand Style. A wide variety of Chian shapes and styles are found dating from the late seventh to the mid-sixth century B.C.</p>

               <p>The catalog is dominated by examples of the chalice shape with almost 140 pieces. By comparison, the next most common shapes, phialai and cups/kantharoi, are represented by only 16 pieces each. A few lid fragments are also found. Another 600 fragments of Chian fine ware were too badly preserved to be cataloged.</p>
