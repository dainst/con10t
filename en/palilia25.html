            <p>Palilia volume 25 offers a comprehensive analysis of the architectural
                history of the luxury villa. It also probes the origins of the fascinating
                building type in its social-historical context. It should be kept in mind,
                that the territory of the rural Latin town of Tibur (Tivoli) constituted
                one of the most important sites of Roman villa culture in the Republican
                period. In the summertime, Roman senators were attracted by the cool atmosphere
                of the Tiburtine slopes in order to escape the bad climatic and narrow
                spatial conditions in Rome. In his study, Martin Tombrägel discusses the
                architectural genesis of the earliest Roman otium-villas at Tivoli. A series
                of imposing elite residences were built here from the early 2nd century
                B.C. and by using caementicium, the new construction technology exciting
                new architectural designs could be realized.</p>
            <p>Individual observations of architecture, building techniques and construction
                phases of every single complex form the basis of the presented results.
                The catalogue of the Tibutine otium-villas comprises 53 villas of the western
                area of Tivoli which signify an important role in the discussion on the
                derivation of the type of construction. In addition, seven villas of the
                eastern area are also included (no. 54 – 60). The catalog is organized
                topographically starting from the north at the hill Colle S. Antonio (no.
                1) and ending in the south at the tuff area in the southwestern part of
                Tivoli (no. 53). Inside the catalog the villas are once more organized
                in geological respect. The description of each otium-villas is largely
                based on the excellent parameters of the Forma Italiae publications (Giuliani,
                Tibur I-II; Mari, Tibur III-IV) which are apart from a few exceptions very
                reliable concerning the map recording. Giuliani's and Mari's descriptions
                were mainly completed regarding the construction technique and additions
                to indications of measurements. When there was no chance to explore a specific
                complex, the given parameters are based on the Forma Italiae. The identification
                of material refers to the author's estimations on site. Mineralogical nuances
                were ignored. Under the category 'dating' there are dating proposals, which
                follow the chronology of construction techniques. When available, additional
                reasons for dating are listed. The discussion of the naming of each Tiburtine
                otium-villa which has always been of importance for scientific research,
                is without meaning in this context. None of the Tiburtine otium-villas
                of the Republican period can be attributed to an ancient personality. Therefore
                issues of naming are only considered in particular high profile cases.</p>
