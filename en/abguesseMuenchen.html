            <h1>Museum for Casts of Classical Sculptures Munich</h1>

            <p>
                The Museum for Casts of Classical Sculptures, which belongs to the State Museums and Collections of Bavaria and at the same time, is the teaching collection of the Institute of Classical Archaeology of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich. The collection consists of more than 2000 casts and reproductions of sculptures, reliefs and small objects from Greek and Roman antiquity from the 7th century BC tot he 5th century AD. The focus lies on Hellenistic sculpture and Roman portraits.
            </p>

                The museum is housed in the building of the Cultural Institutes in the Culture Area of Munich. In 1865 the Ludwig-Maximilians-University established a professorship for classical archaeology, which marked the first point in time that the research of antiquity and the preservation of original works in Munich was taken into the hand of a professional. 
                This pioneering work was taken over by the German archaeologist Heinrich Brunn that transferred from Rome. After a short time, he was also given the supervision of the antiquarian bookshop of the royal residence, the collection of antiquities, the glyptothek, as well as the coin collection, generally speaking, the entire archaeological sector. Brunn wanted create a photo archive and a cast collection as a tool for this task. He received the first funding for a Museum of Plaster-Casts of Classical Sculpture in 1869 after tedious debates. Until 1877, the collection with now 379 casts, was housed with the coin collection in the former Jesuitenkolleg bei St. Michael, later Brunn was given rooms in the northern Hofarkaden of the residence. It still took until 1932 until the collection, now one of the three largest in Germany, could move into its new home. 2398 casts fell victim to a bomb raid in 1944. Around 30 years went by until the museum was systematically rebuilt by Paul Zanker. In 1976 the House of Cultural Institutions at Meiserstraße, today’s Katharina-von-Bora-Straße, became the new location. Due to continuous construction work, it was at times impossible to exhibit the collection. Today the cast collection belongs to the four largest ones in Germany.

                Aside from acquisitions oriented on current research, the holdings of the collection could be enlargend with rare casts of the 19th century. 150 long-term loans of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York replace the most devastating losses of war. One of the attractions of the museum is a colored model of the Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens, which was made around the end of the 19th century and is still the only one that as ever been made.

               The holdings of the Munich Cast Museum have been imported into Arachne since January 2017, also at the same time conducting an auditing. The datasets are improved by photographs: digitized photos of the former photographer Heide Glöcker as well as more recent digital photographs of the current photographer of the museum, Roy Hessing, are inserted. The project fills a desideratum in the cast collection world of Germany by making the historic casts of the Munich collection open to the public.
