                The Villa Wolkonsky in Rome – today the British Ambassador’s Residence - houses in its garden about 430 Roman antiquities collected from the beginning of the 19th-century.

                In 1830, the Russian princess Zinaida Wolkonsky, a woman of great culture, purchased a vineyard, which included 36 arches of the aqueduct of Nero. Zinaida built a summerhouse and transformed the vineyard into an English garden, with fragments of Roman marbles scattered throughout the vegetation.

                After Alexander’s death (1878), his adopted daughter Nadeide, inherited the property and married  Marchese Wladimiro Campanari. The Campanari family built a new mansion, but around the property, a massive urbanization began, involving the loss of part of the garden. Significant excavations preceded this work, bringing to light funerary monuments, mosaics and marbles. 
                After the Campanari family moved to Russia in the early 20th-century, the villa was rented out; in 1915 they returned but sold the property in 1922 - with its full collection of antiquities - to the German government, for use as the new German Embassy.

                At the end of the Second World War, the villa was placed under the Allied Control Commission. In 1947, the Italian government made it available to the British government to use as a temporary embassy and in 1971, the villa reverted to its role as Her Majesty’s Ambassador’s Residence. 
                In 2011, thanks to the Ambassador Christopher Prentice, on the advice of British Museum scholars and with private sponsorship, 360 marbles of the Wolkonsky collection were restored. For reasons of conservation, most of the antiquities have been placed in two 19th-century greenhouses, named the “Wolkonsky Greenhouses Museum”. 

            </p>
                The Arachne collection contains the photographic documentation that was produced during the restoration project, some photographs from the historic collection of  <a href="https://www.dainst.org/standort/-/organization-display/ZI9STUj61zKB/18503" target="_blank">the German Archaeological Institute </a> and a new set of photos that were taken by the photographers of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome in 2018 to complement the documentation and supply high-quality images for research and publications. The important Wolkonsky Collection is thereby available online for the first time for scholarly engagement and public appreciation.
