                The archive of Friedrich W. Hinkel contains over 540 topographic maps in differing formats and materials
                illustrating the entire spectrum of topographic information available for the Sudan.
                The cartographic material belongs to several editions of topographic maps - including official map
                sheets of the Sudan Survey Department as well as calendar sheets – spanning the entire area of the Sudan
                including the Republic of South Sudan. Due to its composition, the archive's map collection represents
                an important source of information for any kind of scientific research regarding the ancient or modern
                Sudan.

                The maps contain a multitude of annotations regarding archaeological sites made by Friedrich W. Hinkel
                in preparation for his publication series “Archaeological Map of the Sudan“ and served as the basis for
                his published hand-drawn maps. Within the iDAI.world the maps were structured according to the
                AMS-system and integrated into iDAI.objects. By virtue of their geographic specifications the maps can
                also be accessed via the iDAI.gazetteer. The copyright for the hand-drawn annotations by Dr. Hinkel
                rests with the DAI.
