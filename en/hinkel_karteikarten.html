                During the course of his time-spanning research in the Sudan Friedrich Hinkel accumulated several
                collections of index cards, of which two were digitized as part of the digitization project. These
                consist of a copy of the inventory of the Sudan National Museum in Khartoum as well as a site catalog
                based on the AMS-system.

                According to Friedrich Hinkel himself, the copy of the inventory of the Sudan National Museum (SNM)
                currently held at the Hinkel-Archive, while exhibiting a couple of gaps, represents the most complete
                version of the inventory up to the year 2004. The beginning of the inventory can be traced back to the
                first law protecting antiquities in the Sudan issued in the year 1905.

                The digitized inventory retains its order by inventory numbers and is divided into 23 sections which
                were added to the iDAI.bookbrowser. Additional copies of the inventory which complement the index
                cards as well as further information can be found in form of lists among the <a
                    href="project/hinkel_wms?lang=de">collections of scientific material</a>.
                Information on the objects referred to by the first 4.000 chronologically issued
                inventory numbers was published by Dr. Friedrich W. Hinkel and Dr. Abdelrahman Ali Mohamed in the year
                2002 as supplement volume III of the “Archaeological Map of the Sudan“. Further publication of the
                material is planned for the next few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to the copy of the inventory of the SNM, the site catalog focuses on sites identified and
                photographed by Hinkel and includes the respective numbers of photographs and slides as well as
                inventory numbers for objects associated with the site. The site catalog is divided into six units,
                which were integrated into the iDAI.bookbrowser.
