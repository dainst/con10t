            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>The Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) is a comprehensive collection
                of ancient Latin inscriptions from all corners of the Roman Empire. Public
                and personal inscriptions throw light on all aspects of Roman life and
                history. The Corpus continues to be updated with new editions and supplements
                by the <a href="http://cil.bbaw.de/index.html" target="_blank">
                    Berlin-Brandenburgischen Akademie der Wissenschaften</a>.</p>
            <p>This digitized version of the CIL will initially comprise of the more
                than 50 parts (of vols. I-XVI + auctaria and of v. I (edition altera))
                published before 1940. Available funding covers the digitization of the
                volumes with an imperfect OCR searching capability. The goal is to eventually
                create a keyword searchable database to contain also future volumes of
                the CIL as they fall outside of copyright restrictions and to eventually
                do the same for the Inscriptiones Graecae.</p>
            <p>The printed version of the CIL presently consists of 17 volumes in approximately
                70 parts, recording some 180,000 inscriptions. Thirteen supplementary volumes
                have plates and specialized indices. The first volume, in two sections,
                covered the oldest inscriptions, to the end of the Roman Republic; volumes
                II to XIV are divided geographically, according to the regions where the
                inscriptions were found and within these divisions also by inscription
                type. A two-volume "Index of Numbers," correlating inscription numbers
                with volume numbers, was published in 2003.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>In 2009 the Heads of the libraries of the American Academy in Rome, Rebecka
                Lindau, and École Française de Rome, Yannick Nexon, met to discuss the
                possibility of digitizing the volumes of the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum
                currently out of copyright. This had been a desire of both for a long time.
                Soon the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut and the Head of its library,
                Thomas Fröhlich, joined the project. Providing a server to host the volumes
                was more of a challenge. The DAI and Reinhard Foertsch at the University
                of Cologne came to the rescue with their object database Arachne, which
                is dynamically connected to international aggregators such as Claros or
                the multinational European project Carare, and freely available on the
                Web.</p>
            <p>The members of the project are:</p>

                the American Academy in Rome; Thomas Fröhlich (thomas.froehlich@dainst.de)
                and Paola Gulinelli (paola.gulinelli@dainst.de), Deutsches Archäologisches
                Institut; Elena Avellino (elena.avellino@efrome.it), l’École française
                de Rome; Reinhard Foertsch (foertsch@uni-koeln.de), Universität zu Köln
                (for Arachne).</p>
            <p>The project partners are grateful to Institutum Romanum Finlandiae, Svenska
                Institutet i Rom, and the British School at Rome for lending some volumes
                for scanning.</p>
