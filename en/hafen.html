            </p>
            <p>The entries into the catalog were made as Arachne object datasets. In order to prevent duplicates, previously existing datasets were supplemented with scenes from the project’s descriptions. The online catalog should link to the respective scene. Further information is included in the dataset of the single objects through the context browser (list view).</p>

            <p>The Mediterranean Sea was the most important traffic and communication space in ancient times. Port cities were the essential intersections of land and sea.  Thus it does not surprise that ports, port cities and maritime cities are depicted in several types of objects, ranging from sarcophagi and funerary reliefs, to wall paintings, mosaics, lamps, glass vessels and coins, state reliefs. Up to now, a detailed analysis and collection of depictions that cover several materials has been missing.</p>
            <p>The desideratum in research is to be filled through the project „Bilder und Vorstellungen
                römischer Hafenanlagen“ schließen, das im Rahmen des Schwerpunktprogramms
                1630 <a href="http://www.spp-haefen.de/" target="_blank">"Harbors from the Roman Imperial age to Medieval times” </a> von der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft
                of the German Research Foundation, which was conducted between 2012 and 2015. On the basis of the comprehensive scientific documentation of the depictions it could be found out, how the people in antiquity perceived harbors and which ideas were connected to them.  It was often assumed that the depictions show buildings that could be identified in real life or associated to certain ports without actually investigating the sources’ background and intention. Just few times can the ensembles be linked to a known port.</p>
            <p>By compiling the depictions it becomes possible to research in which contexts port scenes appear, who the respective initiator and the recipient were, which value they have as a source and thus how they could give information on the buildings at harbor sites.</p>

            <p>In the online catalog, depictions of ports, port cities and maritime landscapes are compiled and documented meticulously. The publication in the form of an online catalog allows that the compiled information will still be available after the project is finished and also still be available worldwide for free to further research.</p>
            <p>The catalog includes depictions of harbors, harbor cities and anchorage sites, maritime buildings (such as lighthouses and ship houses), villae maritimae with wharfs as well as maritime scenes and buildings of harbors.
            Personifications of port cities are only included if there is a secured maritime context, as for example when a ship or a lighthouse is depicted. It is structured by the materials glass, glyptics, lamps, coins, paintings, metal objects, mosaics, reliefs, sarcophagi reliefs and varia. A secondary structure will include sections of the contents of the images. If known, the finds belonging together in context will be presented together. The coins allow a tertiary division into the depicted ports as inscriptions on the coins often allow for the allocation to a specific harbor.
