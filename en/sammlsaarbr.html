            <p><strong>Prof. Dr. Carola Reinsberg, Dr. Arne Thomsen</strong></p>
            <p>The Institute of Classical Archaeology of the University of the Saarland
                possesses a small teaching collection containing originals of antique
                craftwork as well as plaster-casts of ancient sculpture. About 100
                plaster-casts and almost 300 original objects offer an exemplary overview
                of antique art and culture and improve studying by being able to
                immediately view the objects and thereby learn in step with actual
                practice.</p>
            <p>The collection of plaster-casts, a traditional tool for academic
                teaching, enables students to comprehend the main features of the
                development of Greek sculpture from the archaic up to the hellenistic
                period by central works of art and help recognize main aspects of antique
                statuary. Greek and Roman portraits give an insight into portrait art.</p>
            <p>The publication in Arachne makes the casts of the collection of
                Saarbrücken available to students, scientists and the interested public
                without being bound by the location. By integrating them into the
                image-database and into a pool of virtual collections it is possible to
                view each single statue in a dense art historical context. The archival
                contextualization was only manageable in cooperation with the Research
                Archive for Ancient Sculpture. With the help of Arachne's system it offered
                it offered a basis for the digital presentation of the Plaster-cast
                Collection of Saarbrücken, which foots on the images of the Institute's
                master of photography Hans Dieter Morche.</p>
